      "solution": "**Distance of Closest Approach:**\nThe distance of closest approach is the minimum distance between the nucleus and an incoming alpha particle during a head-on collision.

At this distance, the alpha particle momentarily comes to rest before being repelled back.\n\n**Effect of Doubling Kinetic Energy:**\n1. **Kinetic Energy and Distance Relation:** The distance of closest approach ($d$) is inversely proportional to the kinetic energy (K.E.) of the particle:\n$$d \\propto \\frac{1}{K.E.}$$\n2. **Doubling Kinetic Energy:** If the kinetic energy is doubled, the distance of closest approach will be halved. This is because:\n$$d_1 = \\frac{k \\cdot Z_1 \\cdot Z_2 \\cdot e^2}{K.E.}$$\nIf K.E. becomes $2\\,K.E.$:\n$$d_2 = \\frac{k \\cdot Z_1 \\cdot Z_2 \\cdot e^2}{2 \\cdot K.E.} = \\frac{d_1}{2}$$\nThus, doubling the kinetic energy of the alpha particle **reduces the distance of closest approach by half**.",

This phenomenon occurs when a light ray traveling through a denser medium (core) hits the boundary of a less dense medium (cladding) at an angle greater than the critical angle. At this angle, the light ray is completely reflected back into the denser medium rather than refracted into the less dense medium.\n\n[Diagram: A cylindrical optical fibre with the inner core (higher refractive index $n_1$) surrounded by cladding (lower refractive index $n_2$). A light ray enters the core and undergoes repeated total internal reflections at the core-cladding boundary, traveling along the length of the fibre.]\n\n- **Core:** The core is the inner part of the fibre where the light travels. It has a higher refractive index $(n_1)$.\n- **Cladding:** The cladding surrounds the core and has a lower refractive index $(n_2)$. This difference ensures total internal reflection.\n\n**Uses of Optical Fibres:**\n1. **Telecommunications:** Optical fibres are extensively used in telecommunications to transmit data over long distances with high bandwidth and low signal loss.\n2. **Medical Imaging:** Optical fibres are used in medical instruments like endoscopes, which allow doctors to view the inside of a patient's body non-invasively.",

      "solution": "**Working Principle of an LED:**\nA Light Emitting Diode (LED) works on the principle of **electroluminescence**, where light is emitted as a result of the recombination of electrons and holes in a semiconductor material. When a forward voltage is applied across the LED, electrons from the n-type material and holes from the p-type material are injected into the active region (p-n junction). As electrons and holes recombine, energy is released in the form of photons, producing light.\n\n**Advantages of LEDs:**\n1. **Energy Efficiency:** LEDs are highly energy-efficient compared to traditional incandescent and fluorescent lights. They consume significantly less power, leading to reduced energy costs.\n2. **Long Lifespan:** LEDs have a much longer lifespan than conventional lighting sources, often lasting tens of thousands of hours. This reduces the frequency and cost of replacements.\n\n**Disadvantages of LEDs:**\n1. **Higher Initial Cost:** LEDs typically have a higher initial purchase cost compared to traditional lighting options. Although they save money in the long run, the upfront expense can be a barrier.\n2. **Heat Sensitivity:** LEDs are sensitive to high temperatures, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Proper heat management and cooling systems are necessary to maintain their efficiency and longevity.",

      "solution": "Ampere's Circuital Law: $\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I$\n\nWhen applied to a surface cutting the wire during charging of the capacitor, the right-hand side equals $\\mu_0 I$. However, when applied to a surface passing between the capacitor plates (through which no conduction current passes), the right-hand side is zero. This is a contradiction.\n\nThis contradiction can be removed by assuming that a current exists associated with the changing electric field during charging, known as the displacement current:\n$$I_d = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}$$\n\nWhen this term is added, the generalized Ampere's circuital law becomes:\n$$\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_c + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}$$",
