The vector sum of all these contributions cancels completely, giving zero net electric field at the centre.",

      "correctAnswer": "Intensity of radiation depends on the number of photons incident per unit area per unit time. S.I. Unit: $W/m^2$ or $J/(s \\cdot m^2)$",
      "solution": "Intensity of radiation depends on the number of photons incident per unit area per unit time. Also accept: 'number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time'. Alternatively: The amount of light energy/photon energy incident per metre square per second is called intensity of radiation.\n\nS.I. Unit: $W/m^2$ or $J/(s \\cdot m^2)$",

      "question": "The electric current flowing in a wire in the direction from B to A is decreasing. Find out the direction of the induced current in the metallic loop kept above the wire as shown.\n\n[Diagram: A straight horizontal wire with current direction from B (right) to A (left), and a small circular/rectangular metallic loop placed above the wire.]",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Clockwise",
      "solution": "As the current from B to A decreases, the magnetic flux through the loop (directed into the page below the wire) decreases, so by Lenz's law the induced current flows clockwise (when viewed from above) to oppose this change by maintaining the flux. Hence the induced current is clockwise.",

      "solution": "Any two of the following reasons:\n1. AC can be transmitted with much lower energy losses as compared to DC.\n2.

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "As a diverging lens.",
      "solution": "The lens behaves as a diverging lens. Since the refractive index of the lens material (1.25) is less than the refractive index of the surrounding medium — water (1.33) — the lens behaves as if it is in a denser medium. Light rays diverge on going from a rarer to a denser medium. (Alternatively: This can also be shown using the lens maker's formula.)",
