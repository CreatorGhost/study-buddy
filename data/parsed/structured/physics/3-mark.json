Why?\n\n**(b)(ii)** Optical and radio telescopes are built on the ground, but X-ray astronomy is possible only from satellites orbiting the Earth. Why?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "See solution for detailed answers.",
      "solution": "**(a) Two examples:**\n\n1. **Atomic radiation:** Atoms have a characteristic size of about $10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}$. The radiation emitted by electrons transitioning between atomic energy levels falls in the visible or ultraviolet range, with wavelengths of the order of $10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$ — correlated with atomic dimensions.\n\n2. **Radio antenna:** A radio transmitting antenna is typically half a wavelength long. For AM radio waves (wavelengths of hundreds of metres), the antenna is correspondingly tens of metres long. The characteristic size of the radiating system (antenna) is thus directly correlated with the wavelength of the emitted radiation.\n\n**(b)(i)** Short-wave bands (wavelengths of a few to tens of metres) are used for long-distance radio broadcasts because they are reflected by the ionosphere. This allows the waves to travel long distances by repeated reflections between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere, effectively \"bouncing\" the signal around the curvature of the Earth.\n\n**(b)(ii)** The Earth's atmosphere absorbs X-rays strongly (primarily in the upper atmosphere) and does not allow them to reach the ground. Therefore, ground-based X-ray astronomy is impossible. Optical and radio waves, however, pass through the atmosphere with relatively little absorption, allowing optical and radio telescopes to function on the ground. X-ray telescopes must be placed in orbit above the atmosphere to detect cosmic X-rays.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "See solution for detailed answer.",
      "solution": "**Drawbacks of Rutherford's Model:**\n\n1. **Instability of the atom:** According to classical electrodynamics, an accelerating charge radiates energy. An orbiting electron continuously accelerates centripetally and should therefore radiate energy, spiral inward, and collapse into the nucleus within $\\sim10^{-8}\\,\\text{s}$. Rutherford's model could not explain atomic stability.\n\n2. **Discrete spectra not explained:** If electrons could orbit at any radius (continuously losing energy), atoms would emit a continuous spectrum of radiation. Rutherford's model could not account for the observed discrete line spectra of atoms.\n\n**Bohr's Improvements:**\n\n1. Bohr postulated that electrons can only occupy certain **stationary orbits** (quantized orbits) in which they do not radiate energy. An electron radiates only when it transitions between orbits.\n\n2. The condition for allowed orbits is quantization of angular momentum:\n$$L = mvr = \\frac{nh}{2\\pi} = n\\hbar, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$$\n\nThis explained both atomic stability and discrete spectra.\n\n**Orbits are Not Equally Spaced:**\n\nThe radius of the $n$-th Bohr orbit is:\n$$r_n = n^2 a_0, \\quad \\text{where } a_0 = 0.529\\,\\text{Å}$$\n\nThe spacing between consecutive orbits:\n$$\\Delta r = r_{n+1} - r_n = (n+1)^2 a_0 - n^2 a_0 = (2n+1)a_0$$\n\nSince $\\Delta r$ increases with $n$, the orbits are **not equally spaced** — the spacing increases as $n$ increases.\n\nFor example:\n- $r_2 - r_1 = 3a_0$\n- $r_3 - r_2 = 5a_0$\n- $r_4 - r_3 = 7a_0$",

The nucleus contains most of the atom's mass (protons and neutrons), making nuclear matter extremely dense compared to atomic matter.\n\n**(b)** The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons (nucleons) tightly packed together by strong nuclear forces, with virtually no empty space. In contrast, the atom consists mostly of empty space — electrons orbit the nucleus at distances $\\sim10^5$ times larger than the nuclear radius. Therefore, the same mass is concentrated in a volume approximately $(10^5)^3 = 10^{15}$ times smaller, making nuclear density enormously greater than atomic density.\n\n**(c) Density of nuclear matter is constant for all nuclei:**\n\nThe nuclear radius follows the empirical relation:\n$$R = R_0 A^{1/3}, \\quad \\text{where } R_0 = 1.2\\times10^{-15}\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nVolume of nucleus:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (R_0 A^{1/3})^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3 A$$\n\nMass of nucleus (approximately):\n$$M \\approx m_p \\cdot A, \\quad \\text{where } m_p \\approx 1.67\\times10^{-27}\\,\\text{kg}$$\n\nNuclear density:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{M}{V} = \\frac{m_p A}{\\dfrac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3 A} = \\frac{m_p}{\\dfrac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3}$$\n\nSince $m_p$ and $R_0$ are universal constants, $\\rho$ is **independent of $A$** and hence the same for all nuclei.\n\n$$\\rho = \\frac{3m_p}{4\\pi R_0^3} \\approx 2.3\\times10^{17}\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$$",

Modulation shifts the signal to high frequencies (short wavelengths), making antenna size practical.\n\n2. **Effective Power Radiated:** The power radiated by an antenna is proportional to $(l/\\lambda)^2$. For audio frequencies, power radiated is negligible. Carrier waves (high frequency) radiate power effectively.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Mixing / Multiplexing:** Multiple audio signals can be transmitted simultaneously by assigning each a different carrier frequency (frequency division multiplexing), preventing interference between different broadcasts.\n\n(b) Three waveform panels:\n- Carrier wave $c(t)$: High-frequency sinusoidal wave.\n- Message/Audio signal $m(t)$: Low-frequency sinusoidal wave.\n- AM modulated wave $c_m(t)$: High-frequency carrier whose amplitude envelope follows the shape of the message signal.

      "solution": "The three different modes of propagation in a communication system are:\n1. Ground wave\n2. Sky wave\n3. Space wave\n\nWhy EM waves (few MHz to 30 MHz) reflect back to Earth: In the frequency range from a few MHz up to 30–40 MHz, long-distance communication is achieved by ionospheric reflection of radio waves back towards the earth (sky wave propagation). The ionosphere (extending from ~65 km to ~400 km above the earth's surface) contains a large number of ions and free electrons produced by absorption of ultraviolet and other high-energy solar radiation. The ionospheric layer acts as a reflector for frequencies in the range of 3 to 30 MHz, bending the EM waves back toward the earth analogous to total internal reflection.\n\nWhen frequency exceeds 30 MHz: Electromagnetic waves of frequencies higher than 30 MHz penetrate the ionosphere and escape into outer space. They are not reflected back to earth, so ionospheric (sky wave) propagation is not possible beyond this limit. Communication at such frequencies uses space waves or satellite links.",
