      "solution": "Exception handling in Python is achieved using the `try...except` block:\n\n- **`try` block:** Contains the code that might raise an exception.\n- **`except` block:** Contains code to handle the exception if it occurs.\n- **`else` block** *(optional):* Executes if no exception occurs.\n- **`finally` block** *(optional):* Always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n\n**Example — Handling `ZeroDivisionError`:**\n\n```python\ntry:\n    numerator = 10\n    denominator = 0\n    result = numerator / denominator   # This raises ZeroDivisionError\n    print(result)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\nfinally:\n    print(\"Execution completed.\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nError: Division by zero is not allowed.\nExecution completed.\n```\n\nWithout exception handling, the program would **crash** with a `ZeroDivisionError`.

      "solution": "**Cybersecurity** refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.\n\n**Importance in Online Transactions:**\n\n1. **Protection from Fraud:** Cybersecurity measures like **encryption** (e.g., SSL/TLS) ensure that financial data such as credit card numbers and bank account details are transmitted securely, preventing fraud.\n\n2. **Prevention of Unauthorized Access:** **Authentication mechanisms** (passwords, two-factor authentication) ensure that only authorized users can access accounts and perform transactions.\n\n3. **Data Integrity:** Cybersecurity ensures that data is **not tampered with** during transmission. Digital signatures and hashing verify that transaction data remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Privacy Protection:** Measures like **firewalls** and **data encryption** protect personal and financial information from being intercepted by malicious actors.\n\n5. **Building User Trust:** Secure systems encourage users to engage in online commerce with confidence, which is vital for the growth of e-commerce.\n\nIn summary, cybersecurity is the backbone of safe online transactions, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data.",
