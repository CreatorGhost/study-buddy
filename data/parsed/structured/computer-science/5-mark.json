      "question": "Describe, with an example, how the concept of inheritance is implemented in object-oriented programming using Python. Why is inheritance useful?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Inheritance allows a child class to acquire attributes and methods of a parent class. It is implemented using `class ChildClass(ParentClass):` syntax. It is useful for code reusability, extensibility, reduced redundancy, hierarchical classification, and supporting polymorphism.",
      "solution": "**Inheritance** is one of the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a new class (called the **child class** or **derived class**) to acquire the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (called the **parent class** or **base class**).\n\n**Syntax:**\n```python\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n    # additional attributes and methods\n    pass\n```\n\n**Types of Inheritance in Python:**\n1. **Single Inheritance:** One child inherits from one parent.\n2. **Multiple Inheritance:** One child inherits from multiple parents.\n3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a derived class (chain).\n4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from one parent.\n\n---\n\n**Example — Single Inheritance:**\n\n```python\n# Parent class\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name   # instance variable\n\n    def sound(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} makes a generic sound.\")\n\n    def breathe(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} breathes oxygen.\")\n\n# Child class inheriting from Animal\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def sound(self):      # Method Overriding\n        print(f\"{self.name} says: Bark!\")\n\n    def fetch(self):      # New method in child class\n        print(f\"{self.name} fetches the ball.\")\n\n# Child class inheriting from Animal\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def sound(self):      # Method Overriding\n        print(f\"{self.name} says: Meow!\")\n\n# Creating objects\ndog = Dog(\"Buddy\")\ncat = Cat(\"Whiskers\")\n\ndog.sound()      # Output: Buddy says: Bark!\ndog.breathe()    # Output: Buddy breathes oxygen. (inherited from Animal)\ndog.fetch()      # Output: Buddy fetches the ball. (Dog's own method)\n\ncat.sound()      # Output: Whiskers says: Meow!\ncat.breathe()    # Output: Whiskers breathes oxygen. (inherited from Animal)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nBuddy says: Bark!\nBuddy breathes oxygen.\nBuddy fetches the ball.\nWhiskers says: Meow!\nWhiskers breathes oxygen.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Why is Inheritance Useful?**\n\n1. **Code Reusability:** Common attributes and methods defined in the parent class (like `breathe()`) are automatically available to all child classes without rewriting them, saving time and effort.\n\n2. **Extensibility:** Child classes can add new features or **override** existing parent methods (as `Dog` and `Cat` override `sound()`), making it easy to extend existing functionality.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Classification:** Inheritance allows modeling real-world hierarchical relationships (e.g., Animal → Dog → GoldenRetriever), making code more intuitive and organized.\n\n4. **Reduced Redundancy:** Common code is written once in the parent class, reducing duplication and making maintenance easier. If `breathe()` needs updating, only the parent class needs to be changed.\n\n5. **Polymorphism Support:** Inheritance enables polymorphism — the same method name (`sound()`) behaves differently in `Dog` and `Cat`, making programs more flexible and scalable.",

      "solution": "(i) **Branch D** is the most suitable location for the server because it has the highest number of computers (115) and is relatively centrally located with short distances to other branches (35 m to B, 15 m to C, 65 m to A).\n\n(ii) **Star Topology** is ideal for connecting the four branches within Delhi. All branches connect to a central hub/switch (at Branch D), enabling easy fault detection, simple addition/removal, and efficient centralised management.\n\n(iii) A **Switch** should be placed in each branch. Switches connect multiple computers within a branch, direct data only to the intended recipient, reduce collisions, and support full-duplex communication.\n\n(iv) **WAN (Wide Area Network)** will be formed because the distance between Delhi and Kanpur is approximately 300 km, which far exceeds the range of a LAN (within a building/campus) or MAN (within a city, ~50 km).\n\n(v) **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is the most suitable protocol for transferring files between Delhi and Kanpur branches over the WAN connection.",

A `csv.writer` object is created, user inputs are collected, and `writerow()` writes them as a single row.\n\n`COURIER_SEARCH()` opens `'courier.csv'` in read mode, iterates through each row, and checks if the destination field (`row[3]`) matches the input.

        "solution": "**Why closing a file is important:**\n1. Data Integrity: Data may be buffered; closing flushes the buffer ensuring all data is saved.\n2. Resource Release: Open files consume system resources (file descriptors); closing frees them.\n3. Preventing Corruption: Exiting without closing may corrupt or leave the file incomplete.\n4. Accessibility: Other programs cannot access a file while it is open; closing makes it available.\n\n`Add_Book()` opens `'Book.csv'` in append mode and writes a new record with book_ID, B_name, and pub.\n`Search_Book()` opens `'Book.csv'` in read mode, counts rows where `row[2]` matches the input publisher, and prints the count.",

      "solution": "(i) **Suggestion:** Branch D. **Reason:** Branch D has the highest number of computers (115). Placing the server there minimises network congestion and provides better performance, as the majority of users are located there.\n\n(ii) **Suggestion:** Star Topology. Place a central hub/switch at Branch D (which also hosts the server) and connect Branches A, B, and C directly to Branch D. This minimises maximum distance and provides a centralised point for network management.\n\n(iii) **Suggestion:** Switches. Switches efficiently connect multiple computers within a local network and direct data only to the specific intended recipient (using MAC addresses), reducing unnecessary network traffic.\n\n(iv) **Network Type:** WAN (Wide Area Network). **Justification:** The distance between Delhi and Kanpur is approximately 300 km, which far exceeds the typical coverage of LAN (building/campus) or MAN (city, ~50 km). WAN is designed for long-distance communications.\n\n(v) **Suggested Protocol:** FTP (File Transfer Protocol). FTP is specifically designed for transferring files between a client and a server over a computer network.",
