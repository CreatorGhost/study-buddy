      "correctAnswer": "Operons are regulated through inducible systems (e.g., lac operon) where a repressor is inactivated by an inducer to allow transcription, and repressible systems where an end-product co-repressor activates the repressor to block transcription.",
      "solution": "Operons in prokaryotes are units of gene regulation consisting of structural genes, a promoter, and an operator. They can be regulated in two ways:\n\n1. Inducible operons (e.g., lac operon in E. coli): In the absence of a substrate (inducer), a repressor protein binds to the operator and blocks transcription. When the inducer (e.g., lactose) is present, it binds to the repressor, causing it to dissociate from the operator, thereby allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the structural genes.\n\n2. Repressible operons: The operon is normally active (ON), but when the end product (co-repressor) accumulates, it binds to the repressor activating it, which then binds the operator and switches transcription OFF.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that genes are expressed only when needed, conserving cellular energy and resources.",

Denaturation: The double-stranded DNA template is heated (≈ 94°C) to separate (denature) the two strands by breaking hydrogen bonds.\n2. Annealing: The temperature is lowered (≈ 50–65°C) to allow specific short oligonucleotide primers to bind (anneal) to their complementary sequences on each single-stranded template.\n3. Extension: The temperature is raised (≈ 72°C) and Taq DNA polymerase (heat-stable polymerase) extends the primers by adding dNTPs complementary to the template, synthesizing new DNA strands.\n\nThese cycles are repeated 30–40 times, exponentially amplifying the target DNA sequence.",

Kranz anatomy: C4 plants possess a characteristic leaf anatomy called Kranz anatomy, in which the vascular bundles are surrounded by a layer of bundle sheath cells (containing large chloroplasts without grana) and an outer layer of mesophyll cells. CO₂ fixation occurs in mesophyll cells and the Calvin cycle occurs in bundle sheath cells.\n2. Initial CO₂ fixation into a 4-carbon compound: In C4 plants, CO₂ is initially fixed by the enzyme PEP carboxylase (PEPcase) in mesophyll cells to form a 4-carbon compound (oxaloacetate/malate), which is then transported to bundle sheath cells where CO₂ is released and fixed again by Rubisco for the Calvin cycle.

      "solution": "The bone marrow is the site where all blood cells, including lymphocytes, are produced (haematopoiesis). The thymus is the site where T-lymphocytes mature and become immunocompetent. These organs are called 'primary' because immune cells are produced and/or mature there. Importance of T-lymphocytes: (a) Cell-mediated immunity — T-cells directly destroy infected or abnormal cells (cytotoxic T-cells). (b) Helper function — T-helper cells (CD4+) assist B-cells in the production of antibodies. (c) Graft rejection — T-cells are responsible for recognising and rejecting foreign transplanted tissue.

      "correctAnswer": "Benign tumors remain localised and do not metastasise; malignant tumors invade surrounding tissues and metastasise. α-interferons are used because they activate the immune system, inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, and enhance NK cell activity against tumour cells.",
      "solution": "Benign tumors remain localised, do not invade surrounding tissues, do not metastasise, grow slowly, and are enclosed in a fibrous capsule — they are rarely life-threatening. Malignant tumors invade and destroy surrounding tissues, metastasise via blood or lymph to distant organs, grow rapidly, have no capsule, and are highly dangerous (cancer). Some cancer patients are treated with α-interferons (alpha-interferons) because they are biological response modifiers that: activate the patient's own immune system to fight tumour cells; inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells; and enhance the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells that destroy tumour cells. Interferons are proteins naturally produced by virus-infected cells. α-interferons have anti-tumour and antiviral properties and are used therapeutically as immunostimulants in certain cancers (e.g., hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia).",

        "solution": "(i) Co-evolution in Mutualists:\nIn nature, mutualists often co-evolve. For example, in the Mediterranean orchid Ophrys, the plant employs sexual deceit to get pollinated by a species of bee. One petal of the flower resembles a female bee. If the female bee changes its colour pattern even slightly, the success of pollination will be reduced — unless the orchid flower co-evolves to maintain its resemblance to the female bee. This demonstrates co-evolution between the orchid and the bee.\n\n(ii) Mutualists and Biodiversity Loss:\nCo-extinction is one of the 'Evil Quartet' causes of biodiversity loss. In obligatory mutualistic relationships (such as plant–pollinator mutualism), the extinction of one partner will inevitably lead to the extinction of the other partner as well. For example, if a specific pollinator species is eliminated, the plant dependent on it for pollination may also go extinct."

      "question": "Make a list of any three outbreeding devices that flowering plants have developed and explain how they help to encourage cross-pollination.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Three outbreeding devices: (1) Unisexuality/Dioecy, (2) Dichogamy (protoandry or protogyny), (3) Self-incompatibility. Each prevents self-pollination and promotes cross-pollination.",
      "solution": "**Outbreeding devices in flowering plants:**\n\n1. **Unisexuality (Dioecy/Monoecy):**\n   - In **dioecious plants** (e.g., *Cannabis*, *Papaya*), male and female flowers are borne on separate plants, making self-pollination **impossible** and ensuring only cross-pollination (allogamy) occurs.\n   - In **monoecious plants** (e.g., Maize), male and female flowers are on the same plant — this prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy.\n\n2. **Dichogamy:**\n   When the maturation of anthers (pollen release) and stigma receptivity are **not synchronized** in the same flower, self-pollination is prevented. It occurs in two forms:\n   - **Protoandry:** Pollen is released **before** the stigma becomes receptive (e.g., *Salvia*, sunflower).\n   - **Protogyny:** Stigma becomes receptive **before** pollen is released (e.g., *Mirabilis*).\n\n3. **Self-Incompatibility (Self-sterility):**\n   A **genetic mechanism** that prevents germination of self-pollen on the stigma of the same flower, or inhibits pollen tube growth through the style, by recognizing 'self' pollen through **S-gene products**. This ensures fertilization can only occur with pollen from a genetically different individual (e.g., *Nicotiana*, *Petunia*).\n\n4. **Herkogamy:**\n   The anthers and stigma are placed at **different positions/heights** within the same flower, so pollen cannot physically contact the stigma during self-pollination (e.g., pin and thrum flowers in *Primula*).",

        "question": "Why are angiosperm anthers called dithecous? Describe the structure of its microsporangium.",
        "correctAnswer": "Angiosperm anthers are called dithecous because each anther has two lobes (thecae), each containing two pollen sacs (microsporangia), giving four microsporangia total. The microsporangium wall has four layers: epidermis, endothecium, middle layers, and tapetum, surrounding the central sporogenous tissue.",
        "solution": "**Dithecous anthers:** Angiosperm anthers are called **dithecous** (di = two, thecae = cases) because each anther consists of **two lobes (thecae)**, with each lobe containing **two pollen sacs (microsporangia)**. Thus, a typical angiosperm anther has **four microsporangia** in total.\n\n**Structure of Microsporangium:**\n\nIn a transverse section, a typical microsporangium appears **nearly circular** in outline. It is surrounded by **four wall layers:**\n\n1. **Epidermis (outermost):** Single layer; provides protection.\n2. **Endothecium:** Aids in **dehiscence** (opening) of the anther for pollen release; cells develop fibrous thickenings.\n3. **Middle layers:** 2–3 layers; protective function; crushed as the anther matures.\n4. **Tapetum (innermost):** Nourishes the developing **pollen grains (microspores)**; cells possess dense cytoplasm and are often **bi-nucleate or polyploid**.\n\nThe **centre** of the microsporangium is occupied by compactly arranged, homogeneous cells called **sporogenous tissue**, which undergoes meiosis to form **microspore tetrads** and ultimately **pollen grains**.",
