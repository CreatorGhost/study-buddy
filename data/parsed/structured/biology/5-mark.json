      "question": "Describe the lac operon model in prokaryotes. Explain its regulation in the presence and absence of lactose. Illustrate the significance of such gene regulation mechanisms in cells.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "The lac operon (Jacob and Monod, 1961) is an inducible operon in E. coli with structural genes lacZ, lacY, lacA regulated by a repressor. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds the operator and blocks transcription (OFF). In the presence of lactose, allolactose (inducer) inactivates the repressor, allowing transcription (ON). Significance: energy conservation, environmental adaptation, cell differentiation, development, and disease prevention.",
      "solution": "The Lac Operon Model (proposed by Jacob and Monod, 1961)\n\nThe lac operon (lactose operon) is a classic example of an inducible operon in Escherichia coli (E. coli). It controls the metabolism of lactose.\n\nComponents of the lac operon:\n1. Regulatory gene (i gene): Located upstream; codes for the lac repressor protein.\n2. Promoter (P): The site where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription.\n3. Operator (O): The DNA sequence to which the repressor binds; located between the promoter and structural genes.\n4. Structural genes:\n   - lacZ: Codes for β-galactosidase — hydrolyzes lactose into glucose and galactose.\n   - lacY: Codes for permease — facilitates transport of lactose into the cell.\n   - lacA: Codes for transacetylase — transfers acetyl group.\n\nRegulation in the ABSENCE of lactose (Operon OFF):\n1. The i gene is continuously transcribed and translated to produce the lac repressor protein.\n2. The active repressor binds with high affinity to the operator (O) region.\n3. The repressor physically blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA).\n4. No mRNA is produced → No enzymes are synthesized → Lactose is not metabolized.\n\nRegulation in the PRESENCE of lactose (Operon ON):\n1. When lactose is present, it is transported into the cell and a small amount is converted to allolactose (the true inducer) by a few pre-existing β-galactosidase molecules.\n2. Allolactose (the inducer) binds to the lac repressor protein, causing a conformational change.\n3. The allolactose-repressor complex has low affinity for the operator and dissociates from it.\n4. With the operator free, RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes.\n5. The resulting mRNA is translated into β-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase.\n6. These enzymes metabolize lactose efficiently.\n7. When lactose is exhausted, allolactose levels fall → repressor reassumes active conformation → binds operator again → operon turns OFF.\n\n$$\\text{Lactose} \\xrightarrow{\\text{(small amount)}} \\text{Allolactose (inducer)} + \\text{Repressor} \\rightarrow \\text{Inactive complex} \\rightarrow \\text{Operator free} \\rightarrow \\text{Transcription ON}$$\n\nNote: Catabolite repression/CAP-cAMP positive regulation also plays a role: when glucose is absent, cAMP levels rise, cAMP binds CAP protein, and the CAP-cAMP complex binds to the promoter region to enhance transcription.\n\nSignificance of Gene Regulation Mechanisms:\n1. Energy conservation: By expressing genes only when their products are needed, cells conserve significant amounts of energy and biosynthetic resources.\n2. Adaptation to environment: Gene regulation allows organisms to rapidly adapt their metabolism to changing environmental conditions.\n3. Cellular differentiation: In multicellular eukaryotes, differential gene expression is the basis of cell differentiation.\n4. Development and growth: Regulated expression of developmental genes controls the orderly development of organisms.\n5. Disease prevention: Dysregulation of gene expression (especially in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes) leads to diseases like cancer.",

      "question": "Discuss the various evidence supporting the theory of evolution and mention the contribution of molecular biology to evolutionary studies.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Evidence: fossil record, comparative anatomy (homologous/analogous/vestigial organs), embryological evidence, biogeographical evidence, direct observation (antibiotic resistance, industrial melanism). Molecular biology contributions: DNA/protein sequence comparisons, molecular phylogenetics, molecular clock, horizontal gene transfer, pseudogenes, comparative genomics.",
      "solution": "Evidence Supporting the Theory of Evolution:\n\n1. Fossil Record (Paleontological Evidence):\n   - Fossils show a progression from simpler to more complex organisms over geological time.\n   - Transitional fossils (e.g., Archaeopteryx — showing features of both reptiles and birds) provide evidence of evolutionary transitions.\n   - Radioactive dating allows accurate determination of the age of fossils.\n\n2. Comparative Anatomy:\n   - Homologous organs: Similar basic structure and embryological origin but different functions (e.g., forelimbs of humans, horses, whales, and bats). Indicates divergent evolution.\n   - Analogous organs: Different structural origins but similar functions (e.g., wings of birds and wings of insects). Indicates convergent evolution.\n   - Vestigial organs: Reduced, functionless structures (e.g., human appendix, coccyx) that were functional in ancestors.\n\n3. Embryological Evidence:\n   - Biogenetic law (Ernst Haeckel): 'Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' — embryos of different vertebrates show striking similarities in early developmental stages, suggesting common ancestry.\n\n4. Biogeographical Evidence:\n   - Geographical distribution of species supports evolution. E.g., Darwin's finches in the Galápagos Islands — 14 species evolved from a common ancestor, showing adaptive radiation.\n\n5. Direct Observation of Evolution:\n   - Natural selection can be directly observed, e.g., development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, industrial melanism in Biston betularia (peppered moth), and pesticide resistance in insects.\n\nContribution of Molecular Biology to Evolutionary Studies:\n\n1. DNA sequence comparisons:\n   - Comparison of DNA/gene sequences between species reveals the degree of genetic relatedness. Closely related species share more DNA sequence similarity (e.g., humans and chimpanzees share ~99% similarity).\n\n2. Protein sequence analysis:\n   - Comparison of amino acid sequences of conserved proteins (e.g., cytochrome c, hemoglobin) across species gives insights into evolutionary divergence.\n\n3. Molecular phylogenetics:\n   - Using DNA sequences to construct phylogenetic trees depicting evolutionary relationships and divergence times among species.\n\n4. Molecular clock:\n   - DNA sequences accumulate mutations at a roughly constant rate, allowing estimation of divergence times between species based on genetic differences.\n\n5. Horizontal gene transfer:\n   - Molecular biology revealed that genes can be transferred between distantly related organisms, supporting the concept of a 'web of life'.\n\n6. Discovery of pseudogenes and non-coding DNA:\n   - The presence of pseudogenes (non-functional copies of genes) and shared repetitive DNA sequences in related species provides molecular evidence of common ancestry.\n\n7. Genomic comparisons (Comparative genomics):\n   - Whole-genome sequencing and comparison (e.g., human and chimpanzee genomes are ~98.7% identical) provides the most comprehensive molecular evidence for evolution.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Steps: 1. Chemical synthesis of Chain A and Chain B genes. 2. Insertion into plasmid vector (pBR322) downstream of lacZ. 3. Transformation into E. coli. 4. Expression in fermenters. 5. Extraction and cleavage of fusion proteins using CNBr. 6. Purification and combination of chains with disulfide bond formation to produce active insulin. 7. Quality control and packaging.",
      "solution": "Insulin is a protein hormone essential for regulating blood glucose. In 1982, Eli Lilly produced the first recombinant human insulin (Humulin) using E. coli.\n\nStructure of Human Insulin:\n- Chain A: 21 amino acids\n- Chain B: 30 amino acids\n- Connected by disulfide bonds\n- Initially synthesized as proinsulin (with C-peptide)\n\nSteps in Production of Human Insulin:\n\nStep 1 — Isolation/synthesis of insulin genes:\n- The genes encoding Chain A and Chain B of human insulin are chemically synthesized in the laboratory (as the natural gene contains introns that bacteria cannot process).\n- Alternatively, cDNA can be synthesized from mRNA of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells using reverse transcriptase.\n\nStep 2 — Insertion into cloning vector:\n- Each synthesized gene is separately inserted into a plasmid vector (e.g., pBR322) downstream of the β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene promoter, so that insulin chains are expressed as fusion proteins with β-galactosidase.\n- Restriction enzymes cut both the vector and the insulin gene at compatible sites, and DNA ligase joins them to create recombinant plasmids.\n\nStep 3 — Transformation into host bacteria (E. coli):\n- The recombinant plasmids are introduced into E. coli cells separately by transformation (using heat shock or electroporation).\n- Successfully transformed cells are selected using antibiotic resistance markers on the plasmid.\n\nStep 4 — Expression and production:\n- The transformed E. coli cells are cultured in large fermenters (bioreactors) under optimal conditions.\n- The bacteria express the recombinant genes and produce large quantities of insulin A chain and insulin B chain separately as fusion proteins with β-galactosidase.\n\nStep 5 — Extraction and purification:\n- The bacterial cells are lysed and the fusion proteins are extracted.\n- The insulin chains are cleaved from β-galactosidase using cyanogen bromide (CNBr) chemical treatment.\n- The individual A and B chains are purified by chromatography.\n\nStep 6 — Formation of functional insulin:\n- The purified Chain A and Chain B are combined under controlled conditions.\n- Disulfide bonds form between the chains (and within Chain A) to produce properly folded, biologically active human insulin.\n\nStep 7 — Quality control and packaging:\n- The recombinant human insulin is tested for purity, potency, and safety before being formulated into pharmaceutical preparations for clinical use.\n\nSignificance:\n- Recombinant human insulin is identical to natural human insulin, eliminating allergic reactions caused by animal insulin.\n- It can be produced in large quantities at lower cost.",

Logistic growth: dN/dt = rN((K-N)/K) (S-shaped curve, limited resources, stabilizes at carrying capacity K). Relevance: wildlife management (MSY), conservation biology, pest control, human population policy, invasive species management.",
      "solution": "Population ecology studies the size, density, and dynamics of populations.\n\nKey terms:\n- Population size (N): Total number of individuals.\n- Birth rate (b/natality) and Death rate (d/mortality)\n- Intrinsic rate of natural increase (r): r = b - d\n- Carrying capacity (K): Maximum population size an environment can sustainably support.\n\n1. Exponential Growth Model (J-shaped growth)\n\nWhen resources are unlimited, population grows at maximum intrinsic rate r:\n\nDifferential form:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$$\n\nIntegral form:\n$$N_t = N_0 \\cdot e^{rt}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $N_t$ = population size at time $t$\n- $N_0$ = initial population size\n- $r$ = intrinsic rate of natural increase\n- $e$ = base of natural logarithm (≈ 2.718)\n- $t$ = time\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Population size increases without limit — producing a J-shaped curve.\n- The rate of growth increases as population size increases.\n- Applies when resources are abundant, e.g., bacteria in nutrient-rich medium.\n- Limitation: No real population can grow exponentially indefinitely.\n\n2. Logistic Growth Model (S-shaped / Sigmoidal growth)\n\nIn nature, resources are limited. The logistic model incorporates carrying capacity (K):\n\nVerhulst-Pearl logistic equation:\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(\\frac{K - N}{K}\\right)$$\n\nWhere (K-N)/K = the unutilized opportunity for growth:\n- When N << K: growth is approximately exponential.\n- When N = K/2: growth rate is maximal (inflection point).\n- When N = K: dN/dt = 0 — population growth stops.\n- When N > K: growth rate becomes negative.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Produces an S-shaped (sigmoid/sigmoidal) curve.\n- Three phases: Lag phase (slow initial growth), Exponential (log) phase (rapid growth), Stationary phase (growth slows as N approaches K).\n- Example: Sheep population in Tasmania, deer populations in national parks, yeast growth in a flask.\n\nComparison:\nFeature | Exponential Growth | Logistic Growth\nResources: Unlimited | Limited\nCurve shape: J-shaped | S-shaped (sigmoidal)\nGrowth rate: Increases continuously | Increases then decreases\nPopulation limit: No limit | Limited by K\nRealism: Less realistic | More realistic\nEquation: dN/dt = rN | dN/dt = rN((K-N)/K)\n\nRelevance in Ecology:\n1. Wildlife management: Logistic model helps determine maximum sustainable yield (MSY) — harvesting at N = K/2 where growth rate is maximum.\n2. Conservation biology: Helps predict whether small populations of endangered species can recover.\n3. Pest control: Exponential growth models help predict rapid increase of pest populations.\n4. Human population: Logistic considerations inform policies on resource management and family planning.\n5. Invasive species management: New species without predators may initially show exponential growth, causing ecological damage before stabilizing.",

      "question": "What are the consequences of deforestation on biodiversity? Suggest and explain five strategies to manage and conserve forests.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Consequences: habitat loss/fragmentation, species extinction, disruption of ecosystem services, climate change, loss of genetic diversity, disruption of food webs, loss of indigenous knowledge. Strategies: 1. Afforestation/reforestation 2. Sustainable forest management 3. Protected areas 4. Community-based forest management 5. Eco-tourism and biodiversity-friendly practices.",
      "solution": "Consequences of Deforestation on Biodiversity:\n\n1. Habitat loss and fragmentation: Forests provide habitat for an estimated 50–80% of terrestrial species. Deforestation destroys these habitats, leaving species with no place to live, feed, or reproduce. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations, reducing gene flow and increasing inbreeding.\n\n2. Species extinction: Loss of habitat leads directly to population decline and ultimately extinction of species, particularly endemic species with restricted ranges.\n\n3. Disruption of ecosystem services: Forests regulate climate, water cycles, soil formation, and nutrient cycling. Deforestation disrupts these services, leading to soil erosion, altered rainfall patterns, increased flooding, and loss of ecosystem productivity.\n\n4. Climate change: Forests act as carbon sinks. Deforestation releases stored carbon as CO₂, contributing to global warming and climate change, which further threatens biodiversity.\n\n5. Loss of genetic diversity: With population decline and extinction, the genetic diversity within species is lost permanently, reducing the adaptive potential of surviving populations.\n\n6. Disruption of food webs: Loss of keystone species or large numbers of species disrupts predator-prey relationships and entire food webs, causing cascading ecological effects.\n\n7. Loss of indigenous knowledge: Deforestation often displaces indigenous communities whose traditional knowledge about medicinal plants and biodiversity is also lost.\n\nFive Strategies to Manage and Conserve Forests:\n\n1. Afforestation and Reforestation:\n   - Afforestation involves planting trees on land not previously forested; reforestation involves replanting trees in deforested areas.\n   - Planting native species restores habitat, prevents soil erosion, sequesters carbon, and gradually rebuilds biodiversity.\n   - Programs like the Green India Mission and the Bonn Challenge aim to restore millions of hectares of degraded land.\n\n2. Sustainable Forest Management (Sustainable Logging):\n   - Regulating timber extraction through selective logging (harvesting only mature trees), reduced-impact logging, and certified sustainable forestry (e.g., FSC certification).\n   - Establishing rotation periods that allow forests to regenerate before re-harvesting.\n   - This approach balances economic needs with ecological sustainability.\n\n3. Creating Protected Areas (National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Biosphere Reserves):\n   - Designating specific forest areas as legally protected zones where logging, mining, hunting, and destructive activities are prohibited or strictly regulated.\n   - Biosphere reserves (e.g., Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in India) include core zones (strict protection), buffer zones (limited use), and transition zones (sustainable use).\n   - Establishing wildlife corridors between protected areas allows species to migrate and maintains gene flow between fragmented populations.\n\n4. Community-Based Forest Management (Community Forestry / Joint Forest Management):\n   - Involving local communities and indigenous peoples as active stakeholders in forest management decisions, recognizing their traditional knowledge and rights.\n   - Programs like Joint Forest Management (JFM) in India involve local communities in protecting and managing nearby forests in exchange for a share of benefits.\n   - Community stewardship is often more effective and sustainable than top-down government management.\n\n5. Eco-tourism and Biodiversity-Friendly Practices:\n   - Promoting eco-tourism in forested areas generates income for local communities and governments, creating economic incentives to preserve forests rather than convert them.\n   - Encouraging sustainable non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting (e.g., honey, fruits, medicinal plants) that provides livelihoods without destroying the forest.\n   - Education and awareness programs help communities and policymakers understand the value of forest biodiversity and motivate conservation actions.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a) Species diversity decreases from equator (A) to poles (B) — latitudinal gradient. Reasons: higher solar energy near equator; greater climate stability in tropics allowing more speciation. (b) ~1,300 bird species due to diverse habitats and migratory flyways.",
      "solution": "(a) Observation: Species diversity decreases when moving from region 'A' (near the equator / tropics) to region 'B' (higher latitudes / polar regions). This pattern is known as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity.\n\nReasons:\n1. Higher solar energy availability near the equator leads to greater primary productivity, which supports more complex and diverse food webs, enabling a larger number of species to coexist.\n2. Greater climate stability in tropical regions over long evolutionary time periods has allowed more species to evolve and specialise into distinct ecological niches, reducing extinction rates and increasing speciation rates compared to the variable climates at higher latitudes.\n\n(b) India has approximately 1,300 bird species recorded. This high avian diversity is attributed to India's wide range of habitats — forests, grasslands, wetlands, coastal areas, deserts, and mountains — as well as its strategic geographical location along major migratory flyways, which supports both resident and migratory bird populations throughout the year.",

(iii) CsCl separates DNA by buoyant density — heavy, hybrid, and light bands at different positions. (iv) DNA replication is semi-conservative — each daughter molecule has one old and one new strand.",
      "solution": "(i) They used:\n- 15N (heavy nitrogen) — a heavy isotope of nitrogen\n- 14N (light/normal nitrogen) — the common lighter isotope of nitrogen\n\nWhy: These two isotopes were used because they have different atomic masses, causing DNA molecules that contain them to have different densities. This density difference could be detected and separated using CsCl (caesium chloride) density gradient centrifugation, allowing researchers to distinguish between parental (old) DNA strands (labelled with 15N) and newly synthesised strands (labelled with 14N).\n\n(ii) Samples were taken at definite time intervals (corresponding to one generation, two generations, etc.) to observe how the density of DNA molecules changed with each successive round of replication. By comparing the density bands at each generation:\n- Generation 0 (only 15N–15N DNA): one heavy band\n- Generation 1 (after transfer to 14N medium): one hybrid (15N–14N) band at intermediate density\n- Generation 2: one hybrid band + one light (14N–14N) band\n\nThis progressive pattern allowed them to identify the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication.\n\n(iii) The CsCl density gradient centrifugation was used to separate DNA molecules based on their buoyant density. When DNA samples from E. coli grown in different nitrogen media were centrifuged in CsCl solution at high speed, DNA molecules migrated to positions corresponding to their density:\n- 15N–15N DNA (heavy) — settled lower (higher density band)\n- 14N–14N DNA (light) — settled higher (lower density band)\n- 15N–14N DNA (hybrid) — settled at an intermediate position\n\nThis allowed precise physical separation and identification of parental and newly synthesised DNA strands.\n\n(iv) Meselson and Stahl concluded that:\n1. DNA replication is semi-conservative — during replication, the two strands of the parental DNA molecule separate, and each serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.\n2. Each resulting daughter DNA molecule consists of one old (parental) strand and one newly synthesised (daughter) strand.\n3. This was confirmed by the appearance of only hybrid (15N–14N) density DNA after the first generation (ruling out conservative replication, which would produce one all-heavy and one all-light band), and both hybrid and light DNA after the second generation (ruling out dispersive replication).",

These memory cells:\n- Are long-lived and present in large numbers\n- Can be quickly activated without the delay of the primary response\n- Rapidly proliferate and differentiate into effector cells\n\nThis produces a secondary (anamnestic) immune response — characterised by a faster, stronger, and more prolonged increase in antibody concentration, effectively neutralising the pathogen before it causes disease.\n\n(iii)\n- P: Yes (memory cells ARE present in natural active immunity)\n- Q: Getting an infection / natural exposure to the pathogen (e.g., recovering from a disease)\n- R: No (memory cells are NOT present in natural passive immunity — antibodies are transferred ready-made, not produced by the recipient's immune system)\n- S: Yes (antibodies ARE produced in acquired active immunity following vaccination)\n- T: No (antibodies are NOT produced by the recipient in acquired passive immunity — pre-formed antibodies are directly injected)",

(iii) Hereditary: Self-incompatibility (S-locus prevents self-pollen tube growth); Physiological: Dichogamy (anthers and stigma mature at different times — protandry or protogyny).",
      "solution": "(i)\n- 1: Autogamy — transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower\n- 2: Geitonogamy — transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same plant\n- 3: Xenogamy — transfer of pollen from the anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on a genetically different plant (cross-pollination)\n\n(ii)\n(1) Water lily: Water lily achieves pollination by hydrophily (water pollination). In water lilies, pollen grains are released on the water surface and float towards the stigma of other flowers. The pollen grains may also be carried by water currents. In some species, the flower remains at the water surface, facilitating surface hydrophily.\n\n(2) Vallisneria: Vallisneria achieves pollination by hydrophily (specifically, ephydrophily — pollination at the water surface). The male flowers are small and released at the water surface, where they float towards the larger female flowers that are held at the surface by long peduncles. Upon contact, pollination occurs.\n\n(iii)\nHereditary (Genetic) Device — Self-incompatibility:\nSelf-incompatibility (SI) is a genetically controlled mechanism that prevents self-fertilisation. It is governed by a multi-allelic S-locus. When the pollen grain carries the same S-allele as the pistil, a recognition reaction occurs — the pollen tube growth is inhibited either in the stigma or in the style, preventing fertilisation. This ensures that only pollen from a genetically different individual (carrying a different S-allele) can successfully fertilise the ovules, thus promoting outbreeding (xenogamy) and preventing inbreeding depression.\n\nPhysiological Device — Dichogamy:\nDichogamy is the condition in which the anthers and stigma of the same flower mature at different times, preventing self-pollination:\n- Protandry: Anthers mature and release pollen before the stigma of the same flower becomes receptive (e.g., sunflower, marigold).\n- Protogyny: Stigma becomes receptive before the anthers of the same flower mature (e.g., Mirabilis).\n\nBy ensuring that the pollen and stigma of the same flower are not simultaneously functional, dichogamy promotes cross-pollination and helps avoid inbreeding depression.",

FSH levels gradually rise during this phase.\n- Ovarian hormone — Estrogen: Secreted by the growing follicle (granulosa cells) under FSH stimulation. Estrogen causes the proliferation and thickening of the endometrial lining (uterine wall) in preparation for potential implantation. Rising estrogen also exerts positive feedback on the pituitary, contributing to the LH surge.\n\n(2) Days 13–15 (Ovulatory Phase):\n- Pituitary hormone — LH: A dramatic LH surge (sharp peak) occurs around day 13–14, triggered by the positive feedback of high estrogen levels.

        "question": "RNA interference (RNAi) holds great potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of human diseases and as a biocontrol agent for controlling pests in agricultural fields. An experiment was conducted to study the use of RNAi for the potential treatment of disorders of cholesterol metabolism using Cynomolgus monkeys with three groups: (i) RNAi treatment at 1 mg/kg siRNAs, (ii) RNAi treatment at 2–5 mg/kg siRNAs, (iii) saline control. Results shown in a bar graph of relative serum cholesterol (%) vs time (hours) at 24, 48, 144, 264 hours.\n\n(i) What do you interpret from the bars (X and Z) obtained after 264 hours of treatment of monkeys with saline and 2–5 mg/kg siRNAs treatment?\n\n(ii) Name the category of organisms in the living world, where RNA interference (RNAi) takes place. Why?\n\n(iii) What is the basic principle involved in RNA interference (RNAi) in silencing the preferred genes?",

(ii) Eukaryotic organisms — they possess Dicer, Argonaute, and RISC machinery. (iii) dsRNA is processed by Dicer into siRNAs (~21-23 nt), incorporated into RISC, which guides degradation of complementary target mRNA, silencing gene expression.",
        "solution": "(i) From the graph, after 264 hours:\n- Bar X (Saline control): The relative serum cholesterol level remains high (approximately 80–100%), indicating no reduction in cholesterol.\n- Bar Z (2–5 mg/kg siRNA treatment): The relative serum cholesterol level is significantly lower (approximately 40% or below), indicating a substantial reduction.\nInterpretation: The RNAi treatment using 2–5 mg/kg siRNAs was effective in significantly reducing serum cholesterol levels by silencing the 'ApoB' gene, compared to the saline control where no reduction was observed. This demonstrates the therapeutic potential of RNAi in treating cholesterol metabolism disorders.\n\n(ii) RNA interference (RNAi) occurs in eukaryotic organisms. Reason: RNAi is a natural cellular process found in eukaryotes because they possess the necessary molecular machinery (such as the enzymes Dicer and Argonaute proteins, and the RISC complex) required to process dsRNA into siRNAs and execute gene silencing. It functions as a mechanism to regulate gene expression and provide defence against viral infections and transposable elements.\n\n(iii) The basic principle of RNA interference (RNAi):\n1. Introduction of dsRNA: Double-stranded RNA complementary to the target gene's mRNA is introduced into the cell.\n2. Processing by Dicer: The enzyme Dicer (an RNase III enzyme) cleaves the long dsRNA into short fragments of approximately 21–23 nucleotides called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).\n3. RISC formation: The siRNAs are incorporated into a multi-protein complex called the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC).\n4. mRNA degradation: The RISC uses the siRNA as a guide to recognise and bind to the complementary target mRNA.\n5. Gene silencing: The bound mRNA is cleaved and degraded, thereby silencing the expression of the target gene and preventing translation of the corresponding protein.",

(1) CuT (Copper-T) / Copper-releasing IUDs (e.g., CuT-380A, Multiload-375): Mode of action — copper ions (Cu²⁺) released by the device are spermicidal; suppress sperm motility and fertilising capacity; make the uterine environment hostile for sperm survival; may also prevent fertilisation and implantation. (2) Progestasert / Hormone-releasing IUDs (e.g., Progestasert, LNG-IUS/Mirena): Mode of action — slowly release progesterone (or levonorgestrel) into the uterine lumen and endometrium; progesterone makes the uterus unsuitable for implantation (alters endometrial lining); thickens cervical mucus, preventing sperm entry; may suppress ovulation in some cases.

      "correctAnswer": "In the presence of lactose, allolactose (the inducer) binds to the lac repressor, causing a conformational change that reduces its affinity for the operator. The repressor dissociates from the operator, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the structural genes lacZ, lacY, and lacA, producing β-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase to metabolise lactose.",
      "solution": "The lac operon is a classic example of negative inducible gene regulation. Components: Structural genes — lacZ (β-galactosidase), lacY (permease), lacA (transacetylase); Promoter (P) — where RNA polymerase binds; Operator (O) — where the repressor binds; Regulator gene (lacI) — encodes the lac repressor protein (constitutively expressed). Expression in the presence of lactose (inducer present): (1) When lactose is present in the culture medium, it enters the cell (via a small amount of permease already present) and is converted to allolactose (an isomer of lactose) by β-galactosidase. (2) Allolactose acts as the inducer — it binds to the lac repressor protein (a tetramer encoded by the lacI gene). (3) Binding of allolactose to the repressor causes a conformational change in the repressor, reducing its affinity for the operator sequence. (4) The repressor dissociates from the operator, freeing the operator region. (5) RNA polymerase can now bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA) as a polycistronic mRNA (lac mRNA). (6) The lac mRNA is translated to produce: β-galactosidase — cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose; Permease — facilitates entry of lactose into the cell; Transacetylase — transfers acetyl group (role in detoxification). (7) These enzymes metabolise lactose. Once all lactose is consumed, allolactose disappears, the repressor re-binds to the operator, and transcription is switched off (feedback regulation). This is an example of an inducible operon — normally switched off (repressed) but turned on by the presence of the substrate (lactose/allolactose inducer).",

It is produced by the process of transcription, catalysed by the enzyme RNA Polymerase II (in eukaryotes). hnRNA is the primary transcript — a direct copy of the gene (template DNA strand), containing both coding sequences (exons) and non-coding sequences (introns). Processing of hnRNA (pre-mRNA processing) before it becomes functional mRNA: hnRNA undergoes extensive post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus: (1) Capping (5' Capping): A modified guanosine nucleotide (7-methylguanosine triphosphate / m⁷G cap) is added to the 5' end of the hnRNA; occurs even before transcription is complete; Function: protects mRNA from degradation by 5'-exonucleases; aids in ribosome recognition and attachment during translation; facilitates nuclear export. (2) Tailing (3' Polyadenylation): A stretch of 200–300 adenine nucleotides (Poly-A tail) is added to the 3' end of the hnRNA by the enzyme poly-A polymerase, after the transcript is cleaved at a specific site; Function: protects mRNA from degradation by 3'-exonucleases; aids in nuclear export; enhances translation efficiency; determines mRNA stability. (3) Splicing (Removal of introns): The introns (intervening non-coding sequences) are precisely excised (removed) from the hnRNA; the exons (expressed coding sequences) are joined together in a defined order; carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome (composed of snRNPs — small nuclear ribonucleoproteins); alternative splicing can occur, allowing one pre-mRNA to give rise to multiple different mRNA variants. After all three processing steps, the mature mRNA (with 5' cap, exon sequences only, and 3' poly-A tail) is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through nuclear pores for translation by ribosomes.",

(3) Ethical (Intrinsic/moral value): Every species has an intrinsic value and a right to exist regardless of its utility to humans. We share the Earth with millions of other species and have a moral responsibility (stewardship) to protect them and pass on our biological legacy to future generations. The loss of any species represents an irreversible loss of unique evolutionary history — we do not have the right to cause extinctions. Ways that have helped in increasing tiger population in India (Project Tiger launched in 1973): In situ conservation — establishment of Tiger Reserves (Jim Corbett, Ranthambore, Sundarbans, Bandipur, Kanha); Biosphere Reserves, National Parks, and Wildlife Sanctuaries providing legal protection; strict anti-poaching measures and deployment of forest guards; protecting the natural prey base (deer, wild boar); community involvement. Ex situ conservation — zoological parks with captive breeding programmes; cryopreservation of genetic material. Legal and policy measures — Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 bans hunting and trade; CITES bans international trade in tiger parts; National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) monitors and manages tiger reserves. Scientific monitoring — regular tiger census using camera traps and pugmark counting. Result: India's tiger population has shown a significant increase — from approximately 1,411 tigers in 2006 to over 3,000 tigers in recent censuses.",

        "options": null,
        "correctAnswer": "Integrated Organic Farming is a cyclical, zero-waste farming system that integrates multiple agricultural practices where the waste of one process serves as input for another, using organic methods. Ramesh Chandra Dagar integrated beekeeping, dairy management, biogas generation, composting, water harvesting, and chemical-free agriculture so that every output (dung, crop waste, water) fed into another process, achieving zero waste and complete self-sustainability.",
        "solution": "Integrated Organic Farming is a cyclical, zero-waste farming system that integrates multiple agricultural practices in a chain of interdependent processes, such that the waste output of one process serves as an input (nutrient) for another. It uses organic methods — avoiding chemical fertilisers and pesticides — and relies on natural interrelationships between different components (crops, animals, microorganisms, water) to sustain productivity and soil health. Key features: uses organic wastes and biological materials as inputs; incorporates biofertilisers; maintains soil health; minimises external inputs; produces no waste — every output is recycled as an input elsewhere in the system. How Ramesh Chandra Dagar implemented it (Zero Waste Model): (1) Beekeeping — bees pollinate crops (improving yields) and produce honey (additional income); beeswax is also a by-product. (2) Dairy management — cattle are maintained on the farm; their dung is used as organic fertiliser or converted into biogas. (3) Biogas generation — cattle dung is fed into a biogas plant, which produces: Biogas (methane) — used as cooking fuel and energy for the farm; Slurry — the spent material from the biogas plant is a rich organic fertiliser returned to the fields. (4) Composting — crop waste, animal waste, and other organic matter are composted and used to enrich soil fertility naturally. (5) Water harvesting — rainwater is collected and stored for irrigation. (6) Agriculture — crops are grown without chemical pesticides or fertilisers, using compost, biogas slurry, and natural manure produced on-farm. Result (Zero Waste): The output of each process (dung, crop waste, water) feeds into another process as input; no external chemical inputs are needed; no waste is generated; the farm is self-sustaining, economically viable, and environmentally friendly. This model demonstrates the practical success of integrated organic farming as a sustainable agricultural alternative.",

      "solution": "(a)\n(A) Amniocentesis:\nAmniocentesis is a process by which amniotic fluid (fluid present inside the uterus surrounding the unborn baby) is withdrawn from the uterus of a pregnant woman using a needle, to test for developmental and genetic abnormalities of the foetus.\n- Application: It can detect genetic disorders such as thalassemia, Down's syndrome, haemophilia, anaemia, and many other chromosomal abnormalities before birth, enabling informed decisions and early intervention.\n- (Note: It is banned in India for sex determination to prevent female foeticide.)\n\n(B) Lactational Amenorrhea:\nLactational amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation (and ovulation) during the period of intense lactation following childbirth.\n- Application: It acts as a natural method of contraception. Since ovulation does not occur during intense breastfeeding, the chances of conception are almost nil during the first six months after childbirth, provided the mother is fully breastfeeding.\n\n(C) ZIFT (Zygote Intra-Fallopian Transfer):\nIn ZIFT, sperm from a donor male and ova from a donor female are fused (fertilized) in the laboratory (in vitro). The zygote (or early embryo up to 8 blastomeres) so formed is then transferred into the fallopian tube of the recipient woman.\n- Application: ZIFT is used to treat conditions of infertility where the woman cannot conceive naturally, allowing the embryo to travel down the fallopian tube and implant in the uterus naturally.\n\n(b) Poster — Objectives of Reproductive and Child Health Care Programme:\nTitle: 'Safe Life of a Child is Investment for Future'\nKey Objectives:\n- Creating awareness about reproductive health\n- Providing information on contraception and family planning\n- Ensuring safe motherhood and child health\n- Prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs)\n- Promoting breastfeeding and infant nutrition\n- Reducing maternal and infant mortality\n- Providing accessible healthcare services to all sections of society\n- Education about sex and related issues among adolescents",

        "correctAnswer": "(a) 1. Recurrent apomixis: diploid embryo from megaspore mother cell without proper meiosis. 2. Adventive polyembryony: embryos from nucellus or integument cells. (b) Advantage: hybrid vigour maintained year after year. Disadvantage: reduces genetic diversity. (c) Requires emasculation, bagging, intensive labour, and fresh seeds must be bought each season.",
        "solution": "(a) Two Ways by Which Apomictic Seeds Develop:\n1. Recurrent Apomixis (Diplospory/Apospory):\nAn embryo sac develops from the megaspore mother cell without proper meiosis (meiosis is disturbed/suppressed), resulting in a diploid egg cell. The embryo subsequently develops directly from this diploid egg cell without fertilization — producing seeds with the same genetic constitution as the mother plant.\n\n2. Adventive Polyembryony:\nEmbryos arise from a cell or a group of cells either in the nucellus or in the integuments (tissues surrounding the embryo sac), without meiosis or fertilization. For example, in oranges, lemons (Citrus) and roses (Opuntia). Since it occurs outside the embryo sac, it is not grouped with recurrent apomixis. Embryos within the embryo sac may also develop simultaneously, giving rise to polyembryony (multiple embryos per seed).\n\n(b) Advantage and Disadvantage of Apomictic Crops:\nAdvantage: Hybrid vigour is maintained and these seeds can be raised to grow a new crop year after year, resulting in tremendous and consistent crop production without the need for repeated hybridization.\nDisadvantage: Apomixis reduces genetic diversity, as all offspring are genetically identical to the mother plant. This makes crops vulnerable to new diseases or pests.\n\n(c) Why is Production of Hybrid Seeds Costly for Farmers?\nThe production of hybrid seeds involves the process of artificial hybridization, which requires:\n- Labour-intensive steps such as emasculation (removal of stamens from bisexual flowers) and bagging (to prevent contamination by unwanted pollen).\n- Raising of seedlings in nursery beds and controlled crossing.\n- This requires intensive labour and is economically not feasible for small or marginal farmers.\n- Additionally, hybrid seeds cannot be used for the next season's crop (as F₂ offspring do not maintain hybrid vigour), meaning farmers must purchase fresh hybrid seeds every season, further adding to their cost."

      "solution": "Co-dominance:\nCo-dominance is the phenomenon in which both alleles of a contrasting character are expressed equally in the heterozygous condition, with neither allele being dominant over the other.\n\nExample — ABO Blood Groups:\n- ABO blood groups in humans are controlled by three alleles: I^A, I^B, and i.\n- The alleles I^A and I^B are co-dominant — in an individual with genotype I^A I^B, both antigens A and B are produced on the surface of red blood cells, resulting in blood group AB.\n- Neither I^A nor I^B suppresses the expression of the other.\n\nIncomplete Dominance:\nIncomplete dominance is a phenomenon in which one allele shows incomplete (partial) dominance over the other allele. The heterozygous phenotype is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes.\n\nExample — Flower Colour in Antirrhinum (Snapdragon):\n- A cross between red-flowered (RR) and white-flowered (rr) plants gives all pink-flowered (F₁) offspring (Rr).\n- The dominant allele R cannot completely mask the recessive allele r, so the heterozygote shows an intermediate pink colour.\n- RR (Red) × rr (White) → Rr (Pink)\n- F₂ Phenotypic ratio: 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White (i.e., 1:2:1)\n- F₂ Genotypic ratio: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr (i.e., 1:2:1)\n\nKey Difference:\n| Feature | Incomplete Dominance | Co-dominance |\n|---|---|---|\n| Expression | Intermediate/blended phenotype in heterozygote | Both alleles expressed fully and simultaneously |\n| Example | Pink flower in Antirrhinum (Rr) | AB blood group in humans (I^A I^B) |",

        "solution": "(a) Contributions of Scientists:\n| Scientist | Contribution |\n|---|---|\n| George Gamow | Proposed that if 20 amino acids are to be coded by 4 bases, the code must be a triplet (3 nucleotides per codon). Since 4²=16<20 and 4³=64>20, the codon must consist of 3 nucleotides. |\n| Hargobind Khorana | Developed a chemical method to synthesise RNA molecules with defined combinations of bases (e.g., poly UC, poly UG), helping to decipher which codons code for which amino acids. |\n| Marshall Nirenberg | Developed cell-free systems for protein synthesis (in vitro translation). He showed that poly-U RNA coded for polyphenylalanine, identifying the first codon (UUU = Phenylalanine). This helped decipher the genetic code. |\n| Severo Ochoa | Discovered the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase, which helped in the synthesis of RNA with defined sequences in a template-independent manner, facilitating code-breaking experiments. |\n\n(b) Importance of Genetic Code in Protein Biosynthesis:\nThe genetic code is a set of three nucleotides (codon/triplet) that code for a specific amino acid. Its properties and importance in protein biosynthesis:\n1. A codon is a triplet: 4³ = 64 codons (61 sense codons code for amino acids; 3 are stop/nonsense codons — UAA, UAG, UGA).\n2. Unambiguous: Each codon codes for one and only one specific amino acid — there is no ambiguity in translation.\n3. Degenerate: Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon (e.g., Leucine has 6 codons). This provides a buffer against some mutations.\n4. Universal: The genetic code is nearly universal — the same codon codes for the same amino acid in almost all organisms, from bacteria to humans. This is the basis of recombinant DNA technology.\n5. Commaless/Non-overlapping: Codons are read continuously without punctuation marks between them.\n6. AUG (Start codon) — Dual function: AUG codes for Methionine and also acts as the initiation (start) codon for translation.\n7. Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA): Signal the termination of translation, releasing the completed polypeptide chain."

(b) Population density changes due to four factors: Natality (B), Mortality (D), Immigration (I), Emigration (E). ΔN = (B+I) − (D+E).",
      "solution": "(a) Definition of Population:\nThe term 'Population' refers to a group of individuals of the same species living together in a well-defined geographical area, sharing or competing for resources, and potentially interbreeding. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, a group of individuals resulting from even asexual reproduction is also considered a population.\n\n(b) Population Size is Not Static — Justification:\nThe size of a population of any species is not a static parameter. It keeps changing over time depending on various factors including food availability, predation pressures, and weather.\n\nThe population density (N) in a given period changes due to the following four factors:\nΔN = (B + I) - (D + E)\nWhere: B = Natality, I = Immigration, D = Mortality, E = Emigration\n\n1. Natality (B):\nRefers to the number of births during a given period in the population, which are added to the initial density. Higher natality increases population size.\n\n2. Mortality (D):\nRefers to the number of deaths during a given period, which reduces the population size. Higher mortality decreases population density.\n\n3. Immigration (I):\nThe number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the given period. Immigration increases population density.\n\n4. Emigration (E):\nThe number of individuals who have left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the given period. Emigration decreases population density.\n\nThus, if (B + I) > (D + E), population increases; if (B + I) < (D + E), population decreases — demonstrating that population size is dynamic, not static.",

        "correctAnswer": "(a) Hydrarch succession: ecological succession in wetter areas progressing from hydric to mesic conditions, ending in a climax forest. (b) Hydrarch: pioneer = phytoplankton, climax = mesophytic forest. Xerarch: pioneer = lichens, climax = mesophytic forest. (c) Factors: soil condition/fertility, water availability, environmental conditions, seeds/propagules present. Faster because soil already exists with nutrients, organic matter, and propagules.",
        "solution": "(a) Hydrarch Succession:\nHydrarch succession (also called hydrosere) is the ecological succession that occurs in wetter areas (e.g., a freshwater pond or lake). In this type of succession, the successional series progresses from hydric (wet) conditions to the mesic (intermediate moisture) condition, ultimately culminating in a climax community. It begins in an aquatic habitat and progresses toward a land ecosystem.\n\n(b) Comparison of Pioneer Species and Climax Communities:\n| Feature | Hydrarch Succession | Xerarch Succession |\n|---|---|---|\n| Habitat | Starts in a water body (pond/lake) | Starts on bare rock/dry area |\n| Pioneer Species | Phytoplankton (free-floating algae) | Lichens (crustose lichens) |\n| Climax Community | Forest (mesophytic/temperate deciduous forest) | Mesophytic forest |\n(The climax community in both cases is a mesophytic forest in a mesic environment, as both successions progress toward a similar stable climax.)\n\n(c) Factors Determining Pioneer Species in Secondary Hydrarch Succession, and Why It Is Faster:\n\nFactors upon which invading pioneer species depend:\n1. Condition and fertility of the soil already present\n2. Availability of water in the area\n3. Environmental conditions (temperature, light, humidity)\n4. Seeds, spores, and propagules already present in the soil or nearby areas\n\nWhy Secondary Succession is Faster than Primary Succession:\n- In secondary succession, the soil is already present (it exists from the previous community that was disturbed or destroyed).\n- The soil contains organic matter, nutrients, and soil microorganisms, as well as dormant seeds and propagules.\n- Therefore, pioneer species can establish themselves quickly without waiting for soil formation.\n- In primary succession, soil must be gradually formed from bare rock (by weathering, action of pioneer lichens, etc.), which is an extremely slow process taking thousands of years.\n- Hence, secondary succession proceeds at a much faster rate than primary succession."

      "solution": "(a)\n(i) Regulate: Some organisms are able to maintain homeostasis by regulating their body temperatures. The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate body temperature are similar to what humans use.\n- Example: Body temperature remains constant at 37°C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely; when the temperature is much lower than 37°C, we shiver — thus body temperature remains constant.\n\n(ii) Conform: Many animals cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature — these are called conformers. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside.\n- Example: Shrews and hummingbirds\n\n(iii) Migrate: The organism can move away temporarily from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when the stressful period is over.\n- Example: Every winter, the famous Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur hosts thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia and other northern regions.\n\n(iv) Suspend: In animals, if migration is not possible, they might avoid the stress by escaping in time.\n- Example:\n  1.

        "solution": "(a) Menstrual Cycle:\n\n(i) The reproductive cycle in female primates (e.g., monkeys, apes and humans) is called the menstrual cycle.\n\n(ii) The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called menarche.\n\n(iii) In human females, menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next is the menstrual cycle.\n\n(iv) Phases of the Menstrual Cycle:\n\n1. Menstrual phase — Lasts 3–5 days. The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels, which forms liquid that comes out through the vagina. Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised.\n\n2. Follicular phase — Lasts 8–10 days. During this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of the uterus regenerates through proliferation. The secretion of LH and FSH increases gradually.\n\n3. Ovulatory phase — Lasts 1 day. There is release of the ovum.\n\n4. Luteal phase — Lasts 13 days. There is an LH surge. This induces the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle to transform as corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone.\n\n(v) If fertilisation occurs, the endometrium starts preparing for implantation. In the absence of fertilisation, corpus luteum degenerates.\n\n(b) Scientific Understanding of Menstrual Cycle as a Contraceptive Measure:\n\n(i) Safe Period (Rhythm Method):\nA week before and a week after menstrual bleeding is considered the safe period for sexual intercourse. The idea is based on following facts:\n- (A) Ovulation occurs on the 14th day of the cycle and the ovum survives for about 2 days.\n- (B) Sperms remain alive for about 3 days.\nThis method reduces the chances of pregnancy by about 80%.\n\n(ii) Oral Contraceptive Pills:\nPills used by females are also dependent on the menstrual cycle. The pills have to be taken daily for 21 days, starting preferably within the first five days of the menstrual cycle. This is repeated again after a period of 7 days. These pills:\n- Inhibit ovulation and implantation\n- Alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms.",

      "solution": "(a) It is due to polyembryony. Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed is called POLYEMBRYONY. In orange, the nucellar cells, synergid or integument cells develop into a number of embryos of different sizes. Example: Citrus. Sometimes, formation of more than one egg in an embryo sac can also lead to polyembryony. (b) In such embryos, parental characters are maintained; hence they are genetically similar. In this process, there is no segregation of characters in the offspring (progeny).",

(b) Yes — days 10–17 are fertile period; coitus during this period increases conception chances; abstinence prevents pregnancy.",
        "solution": "(a)(i) Menstrual phase: The soft tissue of the endometrial lining of the uterus disintegrates causing bleeding. The unfertilised egg and soft tissues are discharged. It lasts for 3–5 days. (ii) Follicular phase / Proliferative Phase: The primary follicles in the ovary grow and become a fully mature Graafian follicle. The endometrium regenerates. It lasts for about 10 to 14 days. (iii) Luteal phase (Days 15 to 28/29): In this phase, the ruptured follicle changes into corpus luteum in the ovary and it begins to secrete the hormone progesterone. The endometrium thickens further. If the ovum is not fertilised, the corpus luteum undergoes degeneration, causing disintegration of the endometrium and leading to menstruation. (b) Yes, a proper understanding of the menstrual cycle can help immensely in family planning because: Days 10 to 17 of the menstrual cycle are called the fertile period of the human female. If coitus is done during this period, it increases the chances of conception. If coitus is abstained during this period, pregnancy can be prevented.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a) J-shaped (exponential): unlimited resources, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$. S-shaped (logistic): limited resources, carrying capacity K, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(\\frac{K-N}{K}\\right)$. (b) Fitness = reproductive fitness; organisms producing more offspring are selected by natural selection (Differential Reproduction).",
      "solution": "(a) There are 2 models of population growth: (i) Exponential Growth (J-shaped curve): This growth occurs where the resources (food + space) are unlimited. The equation can be represented as: $\\frac{dN}{dt} = (b - d) \\times N$. Let $(b - d) = r$, then: $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$ or $N_t = N_0 e^{rt}$. Where: N = population size, $N_t$ = population density after time t, $N_0$ = population density at time zero, r = intrinsic rate of natural increase, b = birth rate, d = death rate. When N is plotted in relation to time, the curve becomes J-shaped. (ii) Logistic Growth Model (S-shaped curve): This is a realistic approach as resources become limited at a certain point of time. Every ecosystem has limited resources to support a particular maximum carrying capacity (K). When N is plotted in relation to time t, a sigmoid S-shaped curve is obtained, also called the Verhulst-Pearl logistic growth. The equation is: $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(\\frac{K - N}{K}\\right)$. Where: N = population density at time t, r = growth rate, K = carrying capacity. (b) Fitness of a species according to Darwin means reproductive fitness. All organisms after reaching reproductive age have varying degrees of reproductive potential — some organisms produce more offspring and some produce only a few. This phenomenon is also called Differential Reproduction. Hence, the species which produces more offspring are selected by nature (natural selection).",

        "solution": "(a) Ecological Pyramid: The relation between producers and consumers in an ecosystem can be graphically represented in the form of a pyramid called an ecological pyramid. Ecological pyramids are of 3 types: (i) Pyramid of Number: The relationship between producers and consumers in terms of number of individuals at each trophic level.

      "solution": "(a) t-RNA (transfer RNA) reads the genetic code on one hand and transfers amino acids on the other hand, so it is called an adapter molecule by Francis Crick. It is also called soluble RNA (sRNA). Structure of t-RNA: The secondary structure of t-RNA is clover leaf-like but the 3-D structure is inverted L-shaped. t-RNA has five arms or loops: (i) Anticodon loop — Has bases complementary to the codon on mRNA. (ii) Amino acid acceptor end — To which the amino acid binds. (iii) T-loop — Helps in binding to the ribosome. (iv) D-loop — Helps in binding aminoacyl synthetase. (v) Variable loop — No function known. (b) Splicing of hn-RNA: The primary transcripts formed in eukaryotes are non-functional, containing both the coding region (exons) and non-coding region (introns) in RNA — these are called heterogeneous RNA (hn-RNA). hn-RNA undergoes a process where the introns are removed and the exons are joined to form functional m-RNA.

        "solution": "The lac Operon (Inducible Operon): The concept of operon was first proposed in 1961 by Jacob and Monod. Components of the lac operon: (i) Structural genes (z, y, a) — Fragments of DNA which transcribe mRNA for polypeptide synthesis. (ii) Promoter (p) — The sequence of DNA where RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription. (iii) Operator (o) — The sequence of DNA adjacent to the promoter. (iv) Regulator gene (i) — Codes for repressor protein which binds to the operator, switching the operon off. (v) Inducer — Lactose is the inducer which helps in switching the operon on. Gene z codes for β-galactosidase. Gene y codes for permease. Gene a codes for transacetylase. When lactose is absent (Operon switched OFF): The regulator gene (i) produces repressor protein. This repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the operon. The operon is switched off. When lactose is present (Operon switched ON / Open state): Lactose acts as an inducer which binds to the repressor and forms an inactive repressor. The repressor cannot bind to the operator. Now RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and transcribes lac mRNA. Lac mRNA is polycistronic, i.e., it produces all three enzymes: β-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase. The lac operon is switched on.",

Direct Counting (Total Number):\n   - Most appropriate measure for most organisms.\n   - Example: Counting the number of trees per hectare in a forest.\n\n2. Per cent cover or Biomass:\n   - Used when total numbers are meaningless (e.g., comparing one banyan tree with 200 Parthenium plants — the banyan has far greater biomass/cover despite low numbers).\n   - Example: Measuring the per cent ground cover of grass in a meadow.\n\n3. Indirect Methods (Relative Density):\n   - Used when direct counting is impossible or very time-consuming.\n   - Example: Number of fish caught per trap as a measure of the total fish population density in a lake; or pug marks and faecal pellets used for tiger census in national parks and tiger reserves.",

        "solution": "Pyramid of Energy — Always Upright:\n- Energy at a lower trophic level is always more than at a higher trophic level.\n- When energy flows from one trophic level to the next, some energy is always lost as heat at each step (as per the 10% law).\n- Therefore, the pyramid of energy can never be inverted.\n\nExample (Upright Pyramid of Energy):\n- TC (Tertiary Consumers): 10 J\n- SC (Secondary Consumers): 100 J\n- PC (Primary Consumers): 1,000 J\n- PP (Primary Producers): 10,000 J\n- Sunlight Input: 1,000,000 J\n\nPrimary producers convert only ~1% of sunlight energy into NPP.\n\nPyramid of Biomass — Can be Upright or Inverted:\n\nUpright Pyramid of Biomass (e.g., terrestrial ecosystem):\n- TC: 1.5 kg m⁻²\n- SC: 11 kg m⁻²\n- PC: 37 kg m⁻²\n- PP: 809 kg m⁻²\n\nBiomass shows a sharp decrease at higher trophic levels.\n\nInverted Pyramid of Biomass (e.g., aquatic/marine ecosystem):\n- PC (Zooplankton): 21\n- PP (Phytoplankton): 4\n\nThe biomass of fishes (consumers) far exceeds that of phytoplankton (producers) at any given time because phytoplankton reproduce and turn over very rapidly.",

Ovulatory Phase (around Day 14):\n   - Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of the cycle.\n   - A rapid surge in LH (called LH surge) induces the rupture of the Graafian follicle, leading to ovulation (release of the ovum).\n\n3.

        "question": "Explain the process of transcription in prokaryotes. How is the process different in eukaryotes?",
        "solution": "Transcription in Prokaryotes:\n\n- In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA) — all needed to synthesize a protein.\n- There is a single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria.\n\nSteps of Transcription:\n1. Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region and initiates transcription with the help of an initiation factor (sigma factor, σ).\n2. Elongation: RNA polymerase uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrates and polymerises in a template-dependent fashion following the rule of complementarity. It facilitates opening of the DNA helix and continues elongation.\n3. Termination: Once the polymerase reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, as does the RNA polymerase, with the help of a termination factor (rho factor, ρ).\n\n- Since mRNA does not require processing to become active, and transcription and translation occur in the same compartment (no nucleus), transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria.\n\nDifferences Between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Transcription:\n\n1. Coupling: Coupled transcription–translation is the rule in prokaryotes; not possible in eukaryotes.\n2. Location: Occurs in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes; occurs in the nucleus in eukaryotes.\n3. RNA Polymerase: Single RNA polymerase synthesises all three types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) in prokaryotes; three RNA polymerases (I, II, III) synthesise rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA respectively in eukaryotes.\n4. RNA Processing: RNAs are released and processed in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes; RNAs are released and processed in the nucleus (capping, tailing, splicing) in eukaryotes.\n5. Transcriptional Unit: Has one or more genes — polycistronic in prokaryotes; has only one gene — monocistronic in eukaryotes.\n6. rRNA Formation: 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs are formed from a single primary transcript in prokaryotes; 28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs are formed from two primary transcripts in eukaryotes.",

      "solution": "**(a) Griffith's Experiment and the Transforming Principle:**\n\nFrederick Griffith (1928) performed his experiment on *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (pneumococcus), using two strains:\n- **Smooth (S) strain:** Capsulated, **virulent** (disease-causing)\n- **Rough (R) strain:** Non-capsulated, **avirulent** (non-disease-causing)\n\n**Steps of the experiment:**\n\n| Experiment | Procedure | Result |\n|------------|-----------|--------|\n| 1 | Mice injected with **live S-strain bacteria** | Mice **died** (pneumonia) |\n| 2 | Mice injected with **live R-strain bacteria** | Mice **survived** |\n| 3 | Mice injected with **heat-killed S-strain bacteria** | Mice **survived** |\n| 4 | Mice injected with **heat-killed S-strain + live R-strain bacteria** | Mice **died** (live S-strain bacteria recovered from dead mice) |\n\n**Conclusion (Transforming Principle):**\nFrom Experiment 4, Griffith concluded that the **R-strain bacteria had been transformed into virulent S-strain bacteria** by absorbing some **heat-stable material** (the \"transforming principle\") from the heat-killed S-strain bacteria. However, Griffith could not identify the chemical nature of the transforming principle.\n\n**(b) Chemical nature of the Transforming Principle — Avery, MacLeod & McCarty Experiment (1944):**\n\nThey **purified the biochemicals** (DNA, RNA, and Protein) separately from heat-killed S-strain bacteria and conducted the following experiments:\n\n| Treatment | Transformation | Conclusion |\n|-----------|----------------|------------|\n| **Proteinase** (destroys protein) | Transformation **occurred** | Protein is **NOT** the transforming principle |\n| **RNase** (destroys RNA) | Transformation **occurred** | RNA is **NOT** the transforming principle |\n| **DNase** (destroys DNA) | Transformation **did NOT occur** | **DNA IS** the transforming principle |\n\n**Conclusion:** Only DNase treatment inhibited transformation, proving conclusively that **DNA is the transforming principle** — i.e., DNA is the hereditary material responsible for transformation.",

        "correctAnswer": "In absence of lactose: active repressor binds operator, blocks transcription (operon OFF). In presence of lactose: allolactose binds repressor, inactivates it, operator freed, RNA polymerase transcribes lacZ, lacY, lacA producing β-galactosidase, permease, transacetylase (operon ON).",
        "solution": "The **lac operon** is a classic example of **negative gene regulation** in *E. coli*, proposed by François Jacob and Jacques Monod (1961).\n\n**Components of the Lac Operon:**\n- **i gene (Regulator gene):** Codes for the **lac repressor protein**.\n- **Promoter (P):** Site where **RNA polymerase** binds.\n- **Operator (O):** Site where the **lac repressor** binds.\n- **Structural genes:**\n  - **lacZ:** Codes for **β-galactosidase** (cleaves lactose into glucose + galactose)\n  - **lacY:** Codes for **permease** (transports lactose into the cell)\n  - **lacA:** Codes for **transacetylase**\n\n**1.

      "solution": "Plant breeding is a purposeful manipulation of plant species to create new varieties with desired characteristics. The main steps are:\n\n**Step 1: Collection of Variability (Germplasm Collection)**\n- Genetic variability is the **prerequisite** for any breeding programme.\n- All wild species, cultivated varieties, and relatives of the crop are collected from different geographical regions.\n- This collection of diverse alleles for all genes in a crop is called the **germplasm collection**.\n- It is maintained in **gene banks/seed banks** (e.g., National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, India).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluation and Selection of Parents**\n- The entire germplasm collection is **evaluated and screened** for the desired trait(s).\n- Plants possessing the **desired character(s)** are **selected as parents** for the hybridization programme.\n\n**Step 3: Cross-Hybridization among Selected Parents**\n- Hybridization is performed between the selected parents to **combine the desired traits** from two or more parents into a single plant.\n$$P_1 \\times P_2 \\rightarrow F_1 \\text{ (Hybrid)}$$\n- This can be done between varieties of the same species (intervarietal), different species (interspecific), or different genera (intergeneric).\n\n**Step 4: Selection and Testing of Superior Recombinants**\n- The $F_1$ and subsequent generations are evaluated for the **presence and expression of the desired combination** of characters.\n- Plants showing **superior traits** (transgressive segregation) are identified and selected.\n- Selected plants are self-pollinated for several generations to achieve **homozygosity** (true-breeding lines).\n\n**Step 5: Testing, Release and Commercialization of New Cultivars**\n- The selected superior lines are **evaluated in different agro-climatic conditions** for several years (multi-location trials) along with the **best available local check (standard) variety**.\n- If found **superior to local check varieties**, they are recommended for release.\n- Released varieties are **approved by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC)** and made available to farmers for commercial cultivation.",

        "solution": "**(a) Objective of Animal Breeding:**\nAnimal breeding aims at:\n- **Increasing the yield** of domesticated animals (e.g., milk yield in cattle, egg production in poultry).\n- **Improving the desirable qualities** of animal products (e.g., fat content of milk, quality of wool, leaner meat).\n- Developing animals with **disease resistance** and ability to adapt to different climates.\n\n**(b) Importance and Limitations of Inbreeding:**\n\n**Importance (Merits) of Inbreeding:**\n1. **Identification of superior parents:** Superior males and superior females of the same breed are identified and selected for mating.\n2. **Increases homozygosity:** Inbreeding increases the proportion of homozygous loci, producing **pure breeding (true-breeding) lines** with predictable traits.\n3. **Exposes harmful recessive alleles:** Inbreeding brings recessive alleles into a homozygous state so they can be **identified and eliminated by selection**.\n4. **Accumulation of superior genes:** Favourable alleles are accumulated and maintained in the population.\n5. **Increases productivity:** Inbred populations, when true-breeding, often show consistent and improved productivity.\n\n**Limitations (Demerits) of Inbreeding:**\n1. **Inbreeding depression:** Continued and close inbreeding leads to a gradual **reduction in fertility, vigour, and productivity** of the population, resulting from expression of harmful homozygous recessive alleles.\n\n**How to overcome limitations:**\n- After several generations of inbreeding, **selected inbred lines are crossed with each other** (outbreeding/outcrossing). This restores **heterozygosity** and leads to **hybrid vigour (heterosis)**.\n- **Outcrossing** (mating of animals of the same breed but with no common ancestors for 4–6 generations) and **crossbreeding** can counteract inbreeding depression.\n\n**(c) Examples of New Breeds:**\n- **New breed of cattle:** **Karan Swiss** (developed by crossing Sahiwal cows with Brown Swiss bulls for higher milk yield)\n- **New breed of poultry:** **Leghorn** (a high egg-producing breed of domestic fowl)",
