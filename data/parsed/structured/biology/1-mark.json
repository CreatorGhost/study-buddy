      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Seed shape: Round and Wrinkled; Seed colour: Yellow and Green",
      "solution": "Mendel studied seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea plants (*Pisum sativum*). Among those related to seeds, he observed seed shape (round vs. wrinkled) and seed colour (yellow vs. green), which served as clear contrasting characters for his hybridization experiments.",

      "question": "Why is secondary immune response more intense than the primary immune response in humans?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Because our body has immunological memory of the first encounter with the antigen.",
      "solution": "When the immune system encounters an antigen for the first time, it mounts a **primary immune response** and simultaneously produces memory B-cells and memory T-cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen, these memory cells recognize it quickly and mount a **secondary (anamnestic) immune response** that is faster, more intense, and produces a higher titre of antibodies compared to the primary response.",

      "question": "Why is it not possible for an alien DNA to become part of a chromosome anywhere along its length and replicate normally?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Because the origin of replication is not present in the alien/recombinant DNA at arbitrary locations.",
      "solution": "DNA replication in a cell is initiated only at specific sequences called **origins of replication (ori)**. An alien DNA inserted randomly into a chromosome, without possessing or being near a functional *ori*, cannot initiate replication independently. Therefore, it cannot replicate normally unless it is linked to a vector that carries its own origin of replication.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "The C peptide keeps insulin in its inactive (dormant) form called proinsulin.",
      "solution": "Human insulin is initially synthesized as a longer, inactive precursor called **proinsulin**, which consists of three chains — A, B, and C. The **C peptide** (connecting peptide) links the A and B chains and maintains the molecule in its inactive conformation. When proinsulin is processed in the Golgi apparatus, the C peptide is cleaved off, yielding the mature, active insulin molecule consisting of A and B chains linked by disulfide bonds.",

      "solution": "To isolate DNA from cells, the cell wall must first be degraded. Bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan, which is broken down by **lysozyme**. Fungal cell walls are composed of chitin, which is broken down by **chitinase**. In plant cells, **cellulase** is used to degrade the cellulose cell wall.",

      "correctAnswer": "It states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely, and the competitively inferior one will eventually be eliminated.",
      "solution": "Proposed by **G.F. Gause**, the Competitive Exclusion Principle (also called Gause's Principle) holds that when two species occupy the same ecological niche and compete for identical resources, one species will always outcompete the other. The competitively inferior species will either go locally extinct or be forced to shift its niche — a phenomenon known as **niche differentiation**. This principle underscores the importance of resource partitioning in maintaining biodiversity.",

      "solution": "The genus *Glomus* belongs to the group of fungi that form **mycorrhizal** associations with the roots of higher plants. *Glomus* specifically forms **endomycorrhizal (arbuscular mycorrhizal)** associations. The fungal hyphae help the plant absorb water and minerals (especially phosphorus) from the soil, while the plant provides organic carbon (sugars) to the fungus. This is a classic example of **mutualism**.",
