      "question": "Describe the structure of a mature ovule in angiosperms.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "A mature ovule consists of: funicle (stalk), hilum (attachment point), integuments (protective layers), micropyle (pore for pollen tube entry), chalaza (basal region), nucellus (nutritive tissue), and embryo sac (7 cells, 8 nuclei: egg cell, 2 synergids, 3 antipodal cells, central cell with 2 polar nuclei).",
      "solution": "A mature ovule (megasporangium) in angiosperms consists of the following parts:\n\n1. Funicle: The stalk that attaches the ovule to the placenta of the ovary wall.\n2. Hilum: The point of attachment of the funicle to the body of the ovule.\n3. Integuments: One or two protective layers surrounding the nucellus.\n4. Micropyle: A small opening/pore at one end of the ovule formed by the integuments, through which the pollen tube enters during fertilization.\n5. Chalaza: The basal region of the ovule opposite the micropyle, where integuments and nucellus merge.\n6. Nucellus: The central mass of parenchymatous tissue enclosed by integuments, which provides nutrition to the developing embryo sac.\n7. Embryo sac (Female gametophyte): Located within the nucellus; a mature embryo sac contains 7 cells and 8 nuclei:\n   - 1 egg cell (at the micropylar end)\n   - 2 synergids (flanking the egg cell, forming the egg apparatus)\n   - 3 antipodal cells (at the chalazal end)\n   - 1 central cell containing 2 polar nuclei",

      "correctAnswer": "Steps: DNA extraction, restriction digestion, gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, probe hybridization, autoradiography. Significance: Used in criminal investigations, paternity testing, identifying missing persons, and as court evidence.",
      "solution": "Steps of DNA Fingerprinting (developed by Alec Jeffreys):\n\n1. DNA extraction: DNA is isolated from the biological sample (blood, saliva, hair, semen, or any nucleated cell).\n2. Restriction digestion: The extracted DNA is cut into fragments of varying sizes using specific restriction endonucleases.\n3. Gel electrophoresis: The DNA fragments are separated by size on an agarose gel under an electric field — smaller fragments travel farther.\n4. Southern blotting: The separated DNA fragments are transferred (blotted) from the gel onto a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane.\n5. Probe hybridization: Radioactively labelled (or fluorescent) single-stranded DNA probes complementary to specific VNTRs (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) or STRs (Short Tandem Repeats) are added; they hybridize to their complementary sequences on the membrane.\n6. Autoradiography: X-ray film is exposed to the membrane; the labelled probes produce a pattern of bands (the DNA fingerprint) that is unique to each individual.\n\nSignificance in Forensic Science:\n- Used in criminal investigations to match DNA from crime scene samples with suspects.\n- Used in paternity/maternity testing to establish biological relationships.\n- Helps in identifying missing persons or victims of disasters by matching DNA with relatives.\n- Serves as evidence in court proceedings due to its high accuracy and specificity.",

      "question": "How does HIV infect human immune system? Discuss the life cycle briefly.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "HIV binds to CD4+ T-helper cells via gp120, fuses and enters, reverse transcribes its RNA into DNA, integrates as provirus, transcribes and translates viral proteins, assembles and buds new virions, and progressively destroys T-helper cells leading to AIDS.",
      "solution": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a retrovirus that primarily targets and destroys CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes.\n\nLife Cycle of HIV:\n1. Attachment: HIV binds to the CD4 receptor (and co-receptors CCR5/CXCR4) on the surface of T-helper cells via its envelope glycoprotein (gp120).\n2. Fusion and entry: The viral envelope fuses with the host cell membrane, releasing the viral contents (RNA genome + enzymes) into the cell cytoplasm.\n3. Reverse transcription: HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme converts the single-stranded viral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (cDNA).\n4. Integration: The viral DNA (provirus) is transported into the nucleus where integrase enzyme integrates it into the host cell's chromosomal DNA.\n5. Transcription and translation: Host RNA polymerase transcribes the proviral DNA into viral RNA, which is translated into viral proteins.\n6. Assembly and budding: New viral particles are assembled at the cell surface and bud off, acquiring their lipid envelope from the host cell membrane. Protease enzyme matures the new virions.\n7. Host cell lysis: Continuous replication and budding eventually leads to lysis (destruction) of T-helper cells.\n\nConsequence: Progressive destruction of CD4+ T cells weakens the immune system, eventually leading to AIDS, where the patient becomes susceptible to opportunistic infections.",

      "question": "List and explain three post-fertilization events in flowering plants.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "1. Endosperm formation — primary endosperm nucleus (3n) divides to form nutritive endosperm. 2. Embryo development (embryogenesis) — zygote undergoes mitosis and differentiation to form the embryo. 3. Seed and fruit formation — ovule becomes seed, ovary wall becomes fruit.",
      "solution": "Post-fertilization events are changes that occur in the flower after double fertilization:\n\n1. Endosperm formation:\n   - The primary endosperm nucleus (formed by fusion of the two polar nuclei with one sperm nucleus — triple fusion) undergoes repeated mitotic divisions to form the endosperm.\n   - The endosperm is triploid (3n) and serves as a nutritive tissue, supplying nutrients to the developing embryo.\n\n2. Embryo development (Embryogenesis):\n   - The zygote (formed by the fusion of the egg cell and one sperm nucleus) undergoes mitotic divisions and differentiation to develop into the embryo.\n   - The process follows a defined pattern: zygote → proembryo → globular embryo → heart-shaped embryo → mature embryo (with cotyledons, plumule, radicle, and hypocotyl).\n\n3. Seed and fruit formation:\n   - The ovule matures into a seed — the integuments form the seed coat (testa), the nucellus may persist as perisperm, and the embryo + endosperm are enclosed.\n   - The ovary wall (pericarp) develops into the fruit, which encloses and protects the seed(s) and aids in dispersal.\n   - Other floral parts (petals, sepals, stamens) generally wither and fall off.",

      "solution": "Bioremediation is the use of living organisms — primarily microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, algae) but also plants — to degrade, detoxify, or remove pollutants and contaminants from a polluted environment (soil, water, air), restoring it to its natural state.\n\nTypes:\n- In-situ bioremediation: Treatment of contaminated material at the site without excavation.\n- Ex-situ bioremediation: Excavation of contaminated material followed by treatment elsewhere.\n\nMechanisms involved:\n- Biodegradation (breaking down organic pollutants)\n- Bioaccumulation (accumulation of pollutants within organisms)\n- Biostimulation (stimulating native microbial activity by adding nutrients)\n\nExample:\n- Pseudomonas putida (and other hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria) can metabolize and break down crude oil components into harmless byproducts like CO₂ and water. These bacteria are used in oil spill cleanup operations.\n- Phytoremediation using Brassica juncea or sunflowers to absorb heavy metals (like lead, arsenic) from contaminated soil is another example.",

      "question": "Explain the mechanism of photoperiodism in flowering plants.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Photoperiodism is the physiological response of plants to the relative duration of light and darkness. Plants are classified as short-day, long-day, or day-neutral based on critical photoperiod. The photoreceptor phytochrome (Pr/Pfr forms) perceives light in leaves, and florigen (FT gene product) is transported to the shoot apex to initiate flowering.",
      "solution": "Photoperiodism is the physiological response of plants to the relative duration of light and darkness (photoperiod) in a 24-hour cycle, particularly the induction of flowering.\n\nClassification of plants based on photoperiodism:\n1. Short-day plants (SDPs): Flower when the length of continuous darkness exceeds a critical minimum (e.g., Chrysanthemum, Tobacco, Rice).\n2. Long-day plants (LDPs): Flower when the light period exceeds a critical minimum (e.g., Wheat, Spinach, Radish).\n3. Day-neutral plants: Flowering is not controlled by photoperiod (e.g., Tomato, Sunflower, Cucumber).\n\nRole of phytochrome:\n- The photoreceptor phytochrome (a pigment-protein complex) perceives light signals in the leaves.\n- Phytochrome exists in two interconvertible forms:\n  - Pr (phytochrome red): absorbs red light (660 nm) → converts to Pfr\n  - Pfr (phytochrome far-red): absorbs far-red light (730 nm) → converts to Pr; Pfr is the active, biologically effective form\n- In darkness, Pfr slowly reverts to Pr. The ratio of Pr:Pfr and the duration of dark period determines whether a plant will flower.\n\nFlorigen hypothesis:\n- Upon receiving the appropriate photoperiod signal, leaves produce a transmissible flowering stimulus called florigen (now identified as the protein product of the FT gene), which is transported to the shoot apex to initiate flowering.",

      "solution": "1. Greater pest and disease resistance:\n   - GM crops can be engineered to express insecticidal proteins (e.g., Bt crops expressing Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis) that kill specific insect pests. This reduces crop losses and decreases the need for chemical pesticides.\n\n2. Enhanced nutritional value:\n   - GM crops can be biofortified to have improved nutritional profiles. For example, Golden Rice has been genetically modified to produce β-carotene (a precursor of Vitamin A), addressing Vitamin A deficiency in developing countries.\n\n3. Reduced use of chemical pesticides and herbicides:\n   - Herbicide-tolerant GM crops (e.g., Roundup Ready soybeans) allow farmers to use specific herbicides without harming the crop, reducing the overall quantity and variety of chemicals applied. This leads to lower production costs, reduced environmental contamination, and safer food.\n\n(Additional advantages: drought/salinity tolerance, extended shelf life of produce, higher yield.)",

Example: ADA-SCID gene therapy — lymphocytes are isolated, transduced with a retroviral vector carrying the functional ADA gene, and reinfused into the patient to restore immune function.",
      "solution": "Gene therapy is a technique used to correct or replace defective/mutated genes in an individual's cells to treat or prevent genetic diseases.\n\nTypes:\n- Somatic gene therapy: Genes are introduced into somatic (body) cells — changes are not heritable.\n- Germline gene therapy: Genes are introduced into germ cells (eggs/sperm) — changes are heritable (ethically controversial).\n\nExample: Gene therapy for SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency)\n- SCID is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) due to mutations in the ADA gene.\n\nSteps:\n1. Isolation: Lymphocytes (or hematopoietic stem cells) are isolated from the patient's blood/bone marrow.\n2. Ex vivo modification: A functional copy of the ADA gene is introduced into the isolated cells using a retroviral vector as the delivery vehicle.\n3. Selection and culture: Successfully transduced cells are selected and cultured in vitro.\n4. Reinfusion: The genetically corrected cells are reinfused/transplanted back into the patient's body.\n5. Outcome: The corrected cells produce functional ADA enzyme, restoring immune function.\n\nThis was the first clinical gene therapy trial conducted in 1990 by French Anderson on a 4-year-old girl with ADA-SCID.",

      "correctAnswer": "Decomposers break down dead organic matter through fragmentation, leaching, humification, and mineralisation; release inorganic nutrients back into soil for producers; maintain soil fertility through humus; channel energy in detritus food chains; and act as natural waste managers.",
      "solution": "Decomposers (also called saprotrophs or reducers) are organisms — primarily bacteria and fungi — that break down dead organic matter (detritus).\n\nRole of decomposers in ecosystem functioning:\n\n1. Breakdown of organic matter (Decomposition):\n   - Decomposers secrete extracellular enzymes that break down complex organic molecules through:\n     - Fragmentation (breaking into smaller pieces by detritivores)\n     - Leaching (water-soluble nutrients pass into the soil)\n     - Catabolism/humification (formation of humus)\n     - Mineralisation (release of inorganic minerals from humus)\n\n2. Nutrient cycling:\n   - By mineralizing organic matter, decomposers release inorganic nutrients (N, P, K, S, etc.) back into the soil and atmosphere, making them available again for producers. This is essential for biogeochemical cycles.\n\n3. Maintenance of soil fertility:\n   - Decomposers produce humus, which improves soil structure, water retention capacity, and fertility.\n\n4. Energy flow:\n   - Decomposers channel energy from dead organic matter (the detritus food chain) back into the ecosystem.\n\n5. Waste management:\n   - Decomposers act as natural waste managers, preventing accumulation of dead organic matter.\n\nWithout decomposers, nutrients would remain locked in dead organic matter, soil fertility would decline, and life on Earth would be unsustainable.",

      "solution": "(a) Primary sludge refers to the solid matter (suspended solids and settleable particles) that settles at the bottom of the primary settling tank during primary (physical) treatment of wastewater. This sedimentation removes floating debris, grit, and large solid particles. The settled solid material is called primary sludge.\n\n(b) Activated sludge is the biologically active mass produced during secondary (biological) treatment. In the aeration tank, the effluent from primary treatment is aerated and mixed with a microbial inoculum containing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. These microorganisms form flocs that digest dissolved organic matter. The resulting active microbial biomass (floc) is called activated sludge. A portion is recycled back into the aeration tank as inoculum; the rest is pumped to sludge digesters.\n\n(c) Anaerobic sludge digesters are enclosed chambers where the primary and secondary sludge is subjected to anaerobic decomposition by anaerobic bacteria. During this process, the bacteria break down the organic matter in the sludge in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas — a mixture of methane (CH4), CO2, and H2S. This biogas can be used as a source of energy. The digested sludge can be used as manure.",

How does an expression of gene occur in a cell system and when does it need to occur, and how the gene expression is regulated in a prokaryote cell system was studied by the combined efforts of Jacque Monod, the biochemist and Francois Jacob, the geneticist.

(d) Active repressor binds operator, blocking RNA polymerase, no transcription of structural genes.",
      "solution": "(a) The lac operon is said to be a transcriptionally regulated system because the regulation occurs at the level of transcription — the binding or removal of the repressor protein from the operator region directly controls whether RNA polymerase can transcribe the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA). The presence or absence of the inducer (allolactose) determines whether transcription is switched ON or OFF.\n\n(b) The lac operon must remain operational at a very low (basal) level at all times to ensure that a small number of β-galactosidase molecules are always present in the cell. When lactose becomes available in the environment, these few β-galactosidase molecules convert lactose into allolactose (the true inducer), which then binds to the repressor, inactivates it, and allows full induction of the operon.\n\n(c) The regulator gene is marked as the 'i' gene because 'i' stands for inhibitor — the gene codes for the repressor protein (inhibitor), which binds to the operator region and prevents (inhibits) transcription of the structural genes in the absence of the inducer.\n\n(d) Lac operon in absence of inducer (repressed state):\n- Regulator gene (i) → produces active Repressor protein\n- The active Repressor binds to the Operator (O) region\n- Structure: Regulator gene (i) | Promoter (P) | Operator (O) [with Repressor bound] | lacZ | lacY | lacA\n- RNA Polymerase is blocked from proceeding past the Operator\n- Result: NO transcription of lacZ, lacY, lacA structural genes\n\n$$\\underbrace{i}_{\\text{Regulator}} \\quad \\underbrace{P}_{\\text{Promoter}} \\quad \\underbrace{O}_{\\text{Operator}} \\quad \\underbrace{z \\quad y \\quad a}_{\\text{Structural genes}}$$\n\n- Active repressor (encoded by i gene) binds to Operator\n- RNA polymerase is blocked → No transcription\n- No β-galactosidase, permease, or transacetylase produced",

(2) Lichens (Pioneer Species) — first colonisers; secrete acids that weather rock, contributing to soil formation; trap dust and organic matter. (3) Mosses (Bryophytes) — colonise as thin soil accumulates; hold soil and enrich it with organic matter upon death. (4) Herbaceous plants (Grasses and Ferns) — establish as more soil becomes available; root action further breaks rock; organic matter accumulates. (5) Shrubs — replace herbs as soil deepens and nutrients increase; provide shade and shelter. (6) Trees / Forest (Climax Community) — large trees colonise and form a stable, self-sustaining climax forest community that persists under prevailing climatic conditions.

Steps: (1) Primary Treatment (Physical) — screening to remove large debris, grit chambers, and settling tanks where suspended solids settle as primary sludge; primary effluent proceeds to biological treatment. (2) Secondary (Biological) Treatment: (a) Aeration Tanks — primary effluent is pumped into large aeration tanks, mechanically agitated and aerated; aerobic microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) form flocs that consume and decompose organic matter, significantly reducing BOD. (b) Settling Tanks (Secondary Clarifier) — effluent passes into settling tanks where flocs sediment, forming activated sludge. (c) Activated Sludge Recycling — a portion is returned to the aeration tank as inoculum; bulk sludge is pumped into anaerobic sludge digesters. (d) Anaerobic Sludge Digesters — anaerobic bacteria digest organic matter in sludge, producing biogas (methane, H₂S, CO₂) used as energy source. (e) Final Effluent — treated effluent with greatly reduced BOD can be safely discharged into natural water bodies.

      "solution": "Two Advantages of Micropropagation: (1) Rapid mass multiplication — a very large number of genetically identical plants (clones) can be produced from a single plant in a short period. (2) Production of disease-free plants — meristem tissue culture can produce virus-free and pathogen-free plants even from diseased parent plants. Process in the laboratory: (1) Explant selection — a small piece of plant tissue (shoot tip, axillary bud, leaf piece, or root tip) is taken from the selected plant. (2) Surface sterilisation — the explant is surface-sterilised using sodium hypochlorite or ethanol. (3) Inoculation — the sterilised explant is placed on a sterile nutrient medium (containing minerals, sucrose, vitamins, and plant growth regulators — auxins and cytokinins) in a culture vessel under aseptic conditions. (4) Callus formation — the explant dedifferentiates and proliferates to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. (5) Regeneration (Organogenesis/Somatic embryogenesis) — by adjusting the ratio of plant hormones, the callus is induced to form shoots and roots (plantlets). (6) Hardening (Acclimatisation) — the regenerated plantlets are transferred to the greenhouse and gradually acclimatised to natural outdoor conditions before field planting. Two Important Food Plants: (1) Banana (Musa sp.), (2) Potato (Solanum tuberosum).",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Bt produces inactive Cry proteins (protoxins) stored as crystals — harmless to the bacterium at neutral/acidic pH. In the alkaline insect midgut, protoxins are solubilised and activated by proteases, creating pores in midgut epithelial cells, killing the insect.",
      "solution": "Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium. During sporulation, it synthesises crystalline proteins called Cry proteins (δ-endotoxins) encoded by cry genes. These Cry proteins are produced as inactive protoxins within the bacterial cell — in the bacterium itself, the protein exists in an inactive form and does not harm the bacterium. When an insect larva ingests Bt spores or crystals: the alkaline pH of the insect's midgut (pH > 9.5) causes the protoxin crystals to solubilise; alkaline conditions and specific proteases present in the insect gut activate the inactive protoxin by proteolytic cleavage, converting it into the active toxic form. The active Cry toxin binds to specific receptor proteins on the epithelial cells of the insect's midgut, creating pores (ion channels) in the cell membrane, leading to cell swelling and lysis, disruption of the gut epithelium — the insect stops feeding, is paralysed, and eventually dies. Why Bt itself is unaffected: the Cry proteins exist as insoluble crystalline inclusions inside the bacterium at neutral/acidic pH and are thus harmless to the bacterium. The toxin is only activated under the specific alkaline conditions and proteases unique to the susceptible insect's gut — conditions that do not exist inside the bacterial cell itself.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a) Parasites have evolved adaptations such as loss of unnecessary organs, specialised attachment organs, immune evasion, high reproductive capacity, complex life cycles, and reduced virulence. (b) The parasite co-evolves by developing counter-adaptations (antigen variation, new binding sites, immune suppression) to overcome the host's resistance in a continuous 'arms race'.",
      "solution": "(a) Parasites have evolved numerous adaptations: (1) Loss of unnecessary organs — e.g., tapeworms lack a digestive system; Cuscuta lacks chlorophyll. (2) Specialised attachment organs — hooks, suckers, or haustoria to firmly attach to host tissues. (3) Immune evasion — disguising with host proteins, suppressing host immune responses, or antigen variation. (4) High reproductive capacity — producing large numbers of offspring/eggs ensures transmission. (5) Complex life cycles — using intermediate hosts and vectors to enhance transmission efficiency. (6) Reduced virulence over time — natural selection favours reduced virulence, enabling longer co-existence. (b) This is the concept of co-evolution (the 'arms race' between host and parasite): When a host evolves a resistance mechanism, this creates strong selective pressure on the parasite population. Parasites that can overcome the host's resistance will survive and reproduce more successfully. Over successive generations, the parasite co-evolves by developing counter-adaptations — new mechanisms to neutralise or evade the host's resistance (e.g., antigen variation, new binding sites, immune suppression). This reciprocal evolutionary response continues in a cyclical manner, driving both host and parasite to constantly evolve.",

        "solution": "(a) The Pyramid of Energy is the only pyramid that is always upright and is considered the ideal ecological pyramid. It is never inverted. Pyramid of Energy (up to 3 trophic levels): Trophic Level 3 (Carnivores/Secondary Consumers): 100 J; Trophic Level 2 (Herbivores/Primary Consumers): 1,000 J; Trophic Level 1 (Producers/Plants): 10,000 J. The pyramid is upright with the base (Producers) being the widest and the top (Carnivores) the narrowest. According to Lindeman's 10% Law, only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next; 90% is lost as heat during metabolic processes. (b) Only 1% of incident solar energy is fixed by plants through photosynthesis. Energy at Trophic Level 1 (Producers) = 1% × 1,000,000 J = 10,000 J. Applying 10% law: Trophic Level 2 (Herbivores) = 10% × 10,000 = 1,000 J. Trophic Level 3 (Carnivores) = 10% × 1,000 = 100 J.",

      "solution": "(a) Two natural ways carbon is returned to the atmosphere: (1) Respiration by living organisms (plants and animals) — all living organisms carry out cellular respiration; during aerobic respiration, organic compounds (glucose) are oxidised to release energy, producing CO₂ as a by-product: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP). This CO₂ is released into the atmosphere, returning carbon from living organisms back to the carbon pool. (2) Decomposition of dead organic matter by decomposers (bacteria and fungi) — when plants and animals die, decomposers break down complex organic molecules in dead matter through decomposition; this biochemical breakdown releases CO₂ back into the atmosphere and nutrients into the soil. (b) Two human activities that have influenced the carbon cycle: (1) Burning of fossil fuels — coal, petroleum, and natural gas are fossilised forms of ancient organic matter; burning these fuels for energy releases enormous quantities of CO₂ locked away for millions of years, significantly increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and contributing to global warming. (2) Deforestation and burning of forests — forests act as major carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric CO₂ through photosynthesis; cutting and burning forests releases the carbon stored in trees back into the atmosphere as CO₂, and also reduces the capacity of the biosphere to fix CO₂.",

(b) Taq DNA polymerase is thermostable — it retains enzymatic activity even at the high temperatures (~94–95°C) used during the denaturation step of PCR.",
      "solution": "(a) A = Annealing: Short, single-stranded DNA sequences called primers bind (anneal) to their complementary sequences on the separated single-stranded template DNA at a lower temperature (typically 50–65°C depending on primer sequence). Primers define the specific region of DNA to be amplified. B = Extension (Elongation): DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) uses the free 3'-OH of each primer and extends the new complementary DNA strand in the 5'→3' direction, using the deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) present in the reaction mixture, resulting in two complete double-stranded DNA molecules. This occurs at approximately 72°C. The three steps of PCR are: (1) Denaturation at ~94°C → (2) Annealing at ~50–65°C → (3) Extension at ~72°C. (b) The enzyme involved in Step B is Taq DNA Polymerase (isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus). Specific characteristic feature: Taq DNA polymerase is thermostable (heat-stable) — it retains its enzymatic activity even at the high temperatures used during PCR. It has a half-life of approximately 40 minutes at 95°C and an optimum activity temperature of 72°C. This thermostability is essential because the denaturation step of each PCR cycle requires heating to ~94–95°C, which would inactivate most ordinary DNA polymerases. The theoretical amplification of template DNA after n PCR cycles is 2^n.",

      "solution": "(a) S.L. Miller (in 1953, along with Harold Urey) simulated the conditions of primitive Earth: (1) Primitive atmosphere — a mixture of CH₄, NH₃, H₂, and H₂O vapour was taken in a sterile, sealed flask (early atmosphere was reducing — lacking free oxygen). (2) Primitive ocean — a smaller flask half-filled with water was heated to generate water vapour. (3) Energy source (Lightning simulation) — continuous electrical sparks were fired between electrodes in the flask to simulate lightning. (4) Condensation — the simulated atmosphere was cooled through a condenser, causing water (containing any synthesised compounds) to condense and collect in a U-shaped trap, simulating precipitation into the primitive ocean. (b) After running the experiment continuously for about a week, the water in the trap turned pink after one day and deep red and turbid after a week. Analysis using paper chromatography revealed the presence of several amino acids, including α-alanine, β-alanine, aspartic acid, and α-aminobutyric acid (AABA). These amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — had been synthesised abiotically from simple inorganic molecules under simulated primitive Earth conditions. (c) Miller's experiment supports Chemical Evolution (Abiogenesis or prebiotic evolution). Chemical evolution refers to the origin of life through the gradual, abiotic formation of increasingly complex organic molecules from simple inorganic molecules (CH₄, NH₃, H₂, H₂O) present on the primitive Earth. Miller's experiment demonstrated that the building blocks of life (amino acids) can be synthesised spontaneously under conditions resembling primitive Earth — supporting the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis of chemical evolution.",

        "solution": "(a) Linkage and Recombination (T.H. Morgan):\n- T.H. Morgan studied X-linked genes in Drosophila melanogaster.\n- He observed that when two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations was much higher than the non-parental (recombinant) type.\n- He attributed this to the physical association (linkage) of the two genes on the same chromosome and coined the term 'Linkage'.\n- The term 'Recombination' describes the generation of non-parental gene combinations, which occur due to crossing over between linked genes during meiosis.\n- Genes that are tightly linked show very low recombination frequency, whereas loosely linked genes show higher recombination frequency.\n\n(b) Alfred Sturtevant — Gene Mapping:\n- Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes.\n- He mapped their positions on the chromosome — genes with higher recombination frequency are farther apart, and genes with lower recombination frequency are closer together.\n- He thus created the first genetic/chromosome map (linkage map)."

      "solution": "(a) Ailment:\nBoth girls were suffering from ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) Deficiency, a form of SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency). This disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on chromosome 20, which codes for the enzyme Adenosine Deaminase (ADA). Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down the toxic substance deoxyadenosine, which builds up and destroys T and B lymphocytes, severely compromising immunity.\n\n(b) Repeated Visits for Girl A (Enzyme Replacement Therapy):\n- Girl A was given Enzyme Replacement Therapy: lymphocytes were isolated from the patient's blood, cultured in vitro, and functional ADA cDNA was introduced into these cultured lymphocytes.\n- These engineered lymphocytes were then returned to the patient's body.\n- However, lymphocytes are not immortal — they have a limited lifespan.\n- Therefore, repeated infusion of genetically engineered lymphocytes is required periodically, making it not a permanent cure, and the patient must revisit for further treatment.\n\n(c) Permanent Cure for Girl B (Gene Therapy):\n- Girl B was treated with Gene Therapy.\n- The functional ADA gene was isolated and introduced into bone marrow stem cells (or cells at an early embryonic stage).\n- Since bone marrow stem cells are self-renewing and continue producing lymphocytes throughout life, this is a permanent cure — the patient does not need to revisit for further treatment.",

      "solution": "(a) Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products. To produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where large volumes (100–1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required. Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc., using microbial, plant, animal or human cells.\n\n(b) The most commonly used bioreactors are of the stirring type. A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.\n\n- The stirrer facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor.\n- The bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery system, a foam control system, a temperature control system, a pH control system, and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture can be withdrawn periodically.",

      "solution": "(a) Restriction Enzymes:\n1. Restriction enzymes belong to the class of enzymes called nucleases, which break nucleic acids by cleaving their phosphodiester bonds.\n2. Since restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific recognition sites, they are used to cut the donor DNA to isolate the desired gene.\n3. The desired gene has sticky ends which can be easily ligated to a cloning vector cut by the same restriction enzyme, having complementary sticky ends, to form recombinant DNA.\n4. An example is EcoRI, which is obtained from E. coli bacteria 'R' strain and cuts DNA at a specific palindromic recognition site:\n5' G A A T T C 3'\n3' C T T A A G 5'\n\n(b) Plasmids:\n1. Plasmids are autonomous, extrachromosomal, circular double-stranded DNA of bacteria.\n2. Since they are small and self-replicating, they are used as cloning vectors in genetic engineering.\n3. Some plasmids have antibiotic resistance genes which can be used as marker genes to identify recombinant plasmids from non-recombinant ones.\n4. The plasmids are cut and ligated with desired genes and transformed into host cells for amplification to obtain the desired products.\n5. Examples of artificially modified plasmids are pBR322 (constructed by Bolivar and Rodriguez) and pUC (constructed at the University of California).",

Forensic applications: Since DNA from every tissue (blood, hair follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm, etc.) from an individual shows the same degree of polymorphism, it is a very useful identification tool to identify criminals.\n2.

      "solution": "(a) Drosophila melanogaster\n\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes that were sex-linked.\n\nMorgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type.\n\nMorgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome, and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations.\n\nMorgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) while others were loosely linked.\n\n(b) Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and 'mapped' their position on the chromosome.

However, parents should consider that during adolescence, they should behave like friends to their children so that the child can also share problems with them. Parents should give the right information about reproductive aspects, sexual practices and adolescence changes to their children so that they will never be misled. (b) By giving an example of the male honey bee and the orchid Ophrys flower, it is evident that sexual attraction is a natural phenomenon. The honey bee is attracted to an Ophrys flower and assumes one of its petals as its female partner and pseudo-copulates with it.
