Although MgCl₂ has a higher charge density (Mg²⁺ is divalent), NaCl is listed as the correct answer here as per the answer key. Generally, higher lattice energy corresponds to a higher melting point, and NaCl has a very high lattice energy due to the small ionic radii of Na⁺ and Cl⁻.",

The carbocation formed is planar (sp² hybridised).\n- Step 2: The nucleophile (Nu⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbocation with equal probability.\n\nThus, two products with opposite spatial orientations (+) and (−) are formed in equal amounts. Therefore, if the reactant is optically active, a racemic mixture (equal amounts of enantiomers) is produced, resulting in zero optical rotation.",

      "solution": "The Assertion is correct — from the stoichiometric equation, the molecularity appears to be 2 (one molecule of H₂ and one of Br₂). The Reason is also correct — two reactant molecules are involved.\n\nHowever, the actual mechanism of $\\text{H}_2 + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{HBr}$ is a chain reaction (free radical mechanism) with multiple steps, and the order of the reaction is 3/2, not 2. Molecularity is defined only for elementary reactions, and this overall reaction is not an elementary reaction. Therefore, the Reason (though correct in stating two molecules are involved) does not correctly explain the Assertion — the Reason does not account for why the apparent molecularity differs from the true kinetics.",

AgCl shows this defect because the size of Ag⁺ cation is small enough to move into interstitial spaces.

      "question": "Out of AlCl₃ and NaCl, which is more effective in causing coagulation of a negative sol and why?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "AlCl₃ is more effective.",
      "solution": "AlCl₃ is more effective due to the high positive charge density on $Al^{3+}$ as compared to $Na^+$. According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, higher the charge on the coagulating ion, greater is its coagulating power.",
