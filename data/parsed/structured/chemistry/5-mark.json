      "question": "Discuss the principle, working, and applications of the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. Also explain the reactions at both electrodes and the industrial significance of this process.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Electrolysis of molten NaCl involves Na⁺ reduced to Na at cathode, Cl⁻ oxidised to Cl₂ at anode; used industrially for sodium and chlorine production.",
      "solution": "Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride (Down's Process):\n\nPrinciple: Electrolysis is the process of decomposing an electrolyte by passing an electric current through it in the molten/dissolved state. In molten NaCl, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are free to move and can be discharged at respective electrodes.\n\nDissociation of NaCl (in molten state): $$\\text{NaCl} \\rightarrow \\text{Na}^+ + \\text{Cl}^-$$\n\nWorking (Down's Cell): A cylindrical steel cell with a carbon (graphite) anode and a steel cathode (ring-shaped). A diaphragm (iron gauze) separates the products to prevent recombination. Molten NaCl (m.p. 801°C) is taken; CaCl₂ is often added to lower the melting point. Direct current (DC) is passed through molten NaCl.\n\nElectrode Reactions:\nAt Cathode (reduction): $$\\text{Na}^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Na (l)}$$ (Sodium metal is deposited as liquid, collected.)\nAt Anode (oxidation): $$2\\text{Cl}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Cl}_2\\text{(g)} + 2e^-$$ (Chlorine gas is evolved at the anode.)\n\nOverall Cell Reaction: $$2\\text{NaCl} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Na} + \\text{Cl}_2$$\n\nIndustrial Significance: 1. Sodium metal is used as a reducing agent in metallurgy, in making tetraethyl lead (antiknock agent), and in sodium vapour lamps. 2. Chlorine gas is used in water purification, manufacture of PVC, bleaching agents (bleaching powder, NaOCl), and disinfectants. 3. The process is the main industrial source of both elemental sodium and chlorine gas.",

(1 mark)\n(ii) How does the size of blood cells change when placed in an aqueous solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride? (1 mark)\n(iii) 1 molal aqueous solution of an electrolyte A₂B₃ is 60% ionized. Calculate the boiling point of the solution. (Given: $K_b$ for H₂O $= 0.52\\ \\text{K kg mol}^{-1}$) (3 marks)",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(i) O₂ has higher K_H; (ii) Blood cells shrink (crenation); (iii) Boiling point = 101.768°C",
      "solution": "(i) Henry's Law states: p = K_H · x. A higher K_H means lower solubility. Since CO₂ is more soluble than O₂, CO₂ has a lower K_H, and O₂ has the higher K_H.\n\n(ii) A solution containing more than 0.9% (m/v) NaCl is hypertonic relative to the blood cell fluid. When blood cells are placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cells into the surrounding solution by osmosis. This causes the cells to lose water and shrink — a process called crenation.\n\n(iii) Dissociation of A₂B₃: $$\\text{A}_2\\text{B}_3 \\rightarrow 2\\text{A}^{3+} + 3\\text{B}^{2-}$$ Total particles per formula unit: n = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nvan't Hoff factor: $$i = 1 + \\alpha(n - 1) = 1 + 0.60 \\times (5 - 1) = 1 + 2.4 = 3.4$$\n\nElevation in boiling point: $$\\Delta T_b = i \\cdot K_b \\cdot m = 3.4 \\times 0.52 \\times 1 = 1.768\\ \\text{K}$$\n\nBoiling point of solution: $$T_b = 100 + 1.768 = 101.768°\\text{C}$$",

If A and B are mixed such that the mole fraction of A in the mixture is 0.4, calculate the mole fraction of B in the vapour phase. (2 marks)\n(ii) Define colligative property. Which colligative property is preferred for the molar mass determination of macromolecules? (2 marks)\n(iii) Why are equimolar solutions of sodium chloride and glucose not isotonic? (1 mark)",
        "correctAnswer": "(i) Mole fraction of B in vapour phase = 0.33; (ii) Colligative property depends only on number of solute particles; osmotic pressure is preferred for macromolecules; (iii) NaCl dissociates giving i=2, while glucose does not dissociate (i=1), so they have different osmotic pressures.",
        "solution": "(i) Given: P°A = 75 mm Hg, P°B = 25 mm Hg, xA = 0.4, xB = 0.6.\n\nUsing Raoult's Law: $$P_A = x_A \\cdot P°_A = 0.4 \\times 75 = 30\\ \\text{mm Hg}$$ $$P_B = x_B \\cdot P°_B = 0.6 \\times 25 = 15\\ \\text{mm Hg}$$ $$P_{\\text{total}} = 30 + 15 = 45\\ \\text{mm Hg}$$\n\nMole fraction of A in vapour phase: $$y_A = \\frac{P_A}{P_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{30}{45} = 0.67$$\n\nMole fraction of B in vapour phase: $$y_B = 1 - 0.67 = 0.33$$\n\n(ii) Colligative Property: A colligative property is a property of a solution that depends only on the number (concentration) of solute particles present in the solution, and not on the nature or identity of the solute. Examples include: relative lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point, and osmotic pressure.\n\nOsmotic pressure is the preferred colligative property for determining the molar mass of macromolecules because even very dilute solutions of macromolecules produce a measurable osmotic pressure, whereas the other colligative effects are too small to measure accurately at such low concentrations.\n\n(iii) Glucose does not dissociate in water → i = 1. NaCl dissociates completely: NaCl → Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → i = 2. Since NaCl solution has twice as many particles as glucose solution at the same molarity, its osmotic pressure is approximately twice that of the glucose solution (π = iMRT). Therefore, equimolar solutions of NaCl and glucose are not isotonic.",

      "question": "Answer any five of the following:\n\n(a) N,N-diethyl-benzenesulphonamide is insoluble in alkali. Give reason.\n(b) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction. Why?\n(c) Write a simple chemical test to distinguish between methylamine and aniline.\n(d) Write the chemical reaction involved in Gabriel phthalimide synthesis.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a) No N–H hydrogen present to react with alkali; (b) Lone pair on N forms complex with AlCl₃ deactivating the catalyst; (c) Nitrous acid test: methylamine gives N₂ effervescence, aniline gives stable diazonium salt that couples with β-naphthol to give orange-red azo dye; (d) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis involves reaction of phthalimide with KOH, then alkyl halide, then hydrolysis to give primary amine.",
      "solution": "(a) In N,N-diethylbenzenesulphonamide, the nitrogen atom has no hydrogen atom attached to it (both N–H positions are replaced by ethyl groups). Since there is no acidic N–H hydrogen, the compound cannot react with alkali (NaOH) to form a water-soluble sodium salt. Therefore, it remains insoluble in alkali. (Note: Primary sulphonamides R–SO₂–NH₂ and secondary sulphonamides R–SO₂–NHR' dissolve in alkali because their N–H is sufficiently acidic to be deprotonated.)\n\n(b) Friedel-Crafts reactions require a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl₃. Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions because: 1) The lone pair on the nitrogen of aniline acts as a Lewis base and forms a stable acid-base complex with AlCl₃: C₆H₅NH₂ + AlCl₃ → C₆H₅NH₂·AlCl₃⁻. This deactivates and consumes the catalyst. 2) The resulting anilinium salt makes the ring electron-poor (–NH₃⁺ is a deactivating group), preventing the electrophilic substitution needed for Friedel-Crafts.\n\n(c) Use the nitrous acid (HNO₂) test — treat with NaNO₂ + HCl at 0–5°C: Methylamine (primary aliphatic amine) reacts with HNO₂ to form an unstable diazonium salt that immediately decomposes, releasing N₂ gas with effervescence and forming methanol: CH₃NH₂ + HNO₂ → CH₃OH + N₂↑ + H₂O. Aniline (primary aromatic amine) reacts with HNO₂ at 0–5°C to form a stable diazonium salt (benzenediazonium chloride). When coupled with β-naphthol, an intense orange-red azo dye is formed — a positive test. The formation of a stable diazonium salt (confirmed by azo coupling) identifies aniline; the immediate effervescence of N₂ identifies methylamine.\n\n(d) Gabriel phthalimide synthesis involves: Step 1 — Phthalimide reacts with KOH to form potassium phthalimide (K⁺ salt). Step 2 — Potassium phthalimide reacts with an alkyl halide (R–X) via SN2 to give N-alkylphthalimide. Step 3 — N-alkylphthalimide undergoes acid or alkaline hydrolysis to give a primary amine (R–NH₂) and phthalic acid. This method is used to prepare pure primary amines free from secondary and tertiary amines.",

      "question": "Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow:\n\nAmines constitute an important class of organic compounds derived by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of ammonia molecule by alkyl/aryl groups. Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influences their physical properties. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups, respectively increase and decrease their basic character. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom on the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Reactivity of aromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process.\n\n(i) Why does aniline not give Friedel-Crafts reaction?\n\n(ii) Arrange the following in the increasing order of their $pK_b$ values:\n$$C_6H_5NH_2,\\ NH_3,\\ C_2H_5NH_2,\\ (CH_3)_3N$$\n\n(iii) How can you distinguish between $CH_3CH_2NH_2$ and $(CH_3CH_2)_2NH$ by Hinsberg test?\n\n(iv) Write the structures of A and B in the following reactions:\n\n(I) Nitrobenzene reacting with Sn + HCl to give A, then A reacting with $Br_2$ water to give B\n\n(II) $$CH_3CH_2CONH_2 \\xrightarrow{Br_2/alc.\\ KOH} A \\xrightarrow{CH_3COCl,\\ Pyridine} B$$",

      "solution": "(i) Aniline does not give the Friedel-Crafts reaction because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst (like $AlCl_3$), forming an acid-base complex.

        "solution": "(A)(i) Silver is a metallic conductor. As temperature increases, positive metal ions vibrate more intensely, causing greater resistance to electron flow. Silver wire at 30°C has lower resistance and thus greater conductance than at 60°C.\n\n(A)(ii) CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak electrolyte. The degree of ionisation ($\\alpha$) is inversely related to concentration (Ostwald's dilution law): $\\alpha = \\sqrt{K_a/C}$. At lower concentration (0.1 M), the degree of ionisation is higher, meaning more ions are present in solution, giving greater conductance. Thus 0.1 M CH₃COOH has greater conductance than 1 M CH₃COOH.\n\n(A)(iii) KCl is a strong electrolyte (ionic conductor in solution).

        "solution": "(a)(i) o-Nitrophenol vs p-Nitrophenol — Steam Volatility:\n- o-Nitrophenol forms intramolecular hydrogen bonding (between –OH and –NO₂ within the same molecule). This prevents association between molecules, making it volatile (lower boiling point).\n- p-Nitrophenol forms intermolecular hydrogen bonding (between –OH of one molecule and –NO₂ of another).

(a)(iii) Decomposition of ozone is exothermic with increase in entropy, so ΔG < 0 (spontaneous). (b)(i) Nitric oxide (NO). (b)(ii) Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).",
      "solution": "(a)(i) Sulphur in Vapour State is Paramagnetic: Sulphur in vapour state exists as $S_2$ molecules, which are analogous to $O_2$. Like oxygen, $S_2$ has two unpaired electrons in the π* (pi-antibonding) molecular orbitals (following Hund's rule). The presence of unpaired electrons makes $S_2$ paramagnetic.\n\n(a)(ii) N–N bond is weaker than P–P bond: Due to the very small atomic size of nitrogen, the non-bonding lone pairs on adjacent nitrogen atoms experience strong interelectronic repulsion (lone pair – lone pair repulsion). This repulsion weakens the N–N single bond. In contrast, phosphorus has a larger atomic size, so the lone pairs are farther apart and repulsion is much less. Therefore, P–P single bond is stronger than N–N single bond.\n\n(a)(iii) Ozone is thermodynamically less stable than oxygen: The decomposition of ozone into oxygen:\n$$2O_3(g) \\longrightarrow 3O_2(g)$$\nThis reaction results in liberation of heat ($\\Delta H < 0$, exothermic) and increase in entropy ($\\Delta S > 0$, more moles of gas). Together, these give a large negative Gibbs energy change ($\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S < 0$), meaning the decomposition is spontaneous.

Overvoltage (overpotential): Oxidation of water to O₂ requires a significantly higher overvoltage than predicted by thermodynamics.\n2.

It depends on the number of ions per unit volume. When acetic acid (a weak electrolyte) is diluted:\n- Although the degree of dissociation increases (more molecules ionise)\n- The number of ions per unit volume (concentration) decreases significantly.\nThe decrease in ion concentration per unit volume outweighs the increase in degree of dissociation.

      "question": "Give reasons:\n\n(i) H₃PO₃ undergoes disproportionation reaction but H₃PO₄ does not.\n\n(ii) When Cl₂ reacts with excess of F₂, ClF₃ is formed and not FCl₃.\n\n(iii) Dioxygen is a gas while Sulphur is a solid at room temperature.",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(i) P in H₃PO₃ is +3 (intermediate oxidation state, can disproportionate); P in H₃PO₄ is +5 (highest oxidation state, cannot be oxidised further).\n(ii) F cannot show positive oxidation states; Cl can show +3 in ClF₃.\n(iii) O₂ is a diatomic molecule with weak van der Waals forces; S forms S₈ rings with stronger intermolecular forces.",
      "solution": "(i) In $\\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_3$ (phosphorous acid): Oxidation state of P = +3. Since P is in an intermediate oxidation state (+3), it can undergo both oxidation (to +5) and reduction (to 0 or –3). Therefore, H₃PO₃ can disproportionate:\n$$4\\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_3 \\longrightarrow 3\\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_4 + \\text{PH}_3$$\n\nIn $\\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_4$ (phosphoric acid): Oxidation state of P = +5. This is the highest oxidation state of phosphorus. It can only undergo reduction (act as oxidising agent) but cannot be oxidised further. Therefore, H₃PO₄ cannot undergo disproportionation.\n\n(ii) Fluorine is the most electronegative element and can exist only in the –1 oxidation state. It cannot show positive oxidation states.\nChlorine, being less electronegative, can show positive oxidation states when bonded to the more electronegative fluorine.\nIn $\\text{ClF}_3$: Cl has oxidation state = +3 (which is possible for Cl).\nIf $\\text{FCl}_3$ were formed, F would need to be in +3 oxidation state — which is impossible for fluorine due to its high electronegativity and absence of d-orbitals.\nTherefore, only $\\text{ClF}_3$ is formed, not $\\text{FCl}_3$.\n\n(iii) O₂ (Dioxygen): Oxygen forms a diatomic molecule ($\\text{O}=\\text{O}$) with a $p\\pi – p\\pi$ double bond (due to small size and availability of p-orbitals for lateral overlap). The intermolecular forces in O₂ are very weak van der Waals forces. Therefore, dioxygen is a gas at room temperature with very low boiling point.\nSulphur: Due to its larger atomic size, sulphur cannot form $p\\pi – p\\pi$ bonds effectively. Instead, it forms puckered S₈ rings held together by stronger van der Waals forces due to the larger molecular size and higher molecular mass of S₈. These stronger intermolecular forces keep sulphur as a solid at room temperature.",

Difference: Actinoids form oxo-cations (e.g., UO₂²⁺); lanthanoids do not.",
      "solution": "**(a)(i) Variable oxidation states in transition metals:**\n\nIn transition elements, both **ns** and **(n–1)d** electrons participate in bonding due to very little energy difference between them. When only ns electrons take part in bonding, they exhibit lower oxidation states. When both ns and (n–1)d electrons participate, they exhibit higher oxidation states. This leads to **variable oxidation states**.\n\n**(a)(ii) Zn, Cd and Hg are soft metals:**\n\nTransition elements are generally hard and have high melting and boiling points because they exhibit both **covalent and metallic bonding** due to partially filled d-orbitals. However, Group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg) have **completely filled (n–1)d orbitals** ($d^{10}$ configuration), so they cannot exhibit covalent bonding through d-orbitals. Only weak metallic bonds exist, making them **soft metals** with low melting points.\n\n**(a)(iii) $E°$ for $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ is highly positive:**\n\n$Mn^{2+}$ has a $d^5$ (half-filled) configuration, which is **extra stable** due to exchange energy. Therefore, $Mn^{3+}$ readily gets reduced to the stable $Mn^{2+}$, resulting in a **high positive $E°$** value for the $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ couple.\n\nIn contrast, $Cr^{3+}$ ($d^3$, half-filled $t_{2g}$) is more stable than $Cr^{2+}$, so $Cr^{3+}$ does not easily reduce to $Cr^{2+}$, resulting in a **low $E°$** value.\n\n**(b) Lanthanoids vs. Actinoids:**\n\n**Similarity:**\n- Both series of elements exhibit mainly **+3 oxidation state**.\n\n**Difference:**\n\n| Lanthanoids | Actinoids |\n|---|---|\n| Less tendency to form complexes | High tendency to form complexes |\n| Do not form oxo-cations | Form oxo-cations, e.g., $UO_2^{2+}$, $TiO^{2+}$ |",

It has a small size and high charge density, making it strongly stabilized by hydration in aqueous solution.\n\n**(a)(ii) Strong oxidising agent:**\n\n**$Mn^{3+}$** is the strongest oxidising agent.\n\n**Reason:** $Mn^{2+}$ ($d^5$, half-filled) is more stable than $Mn^{3+}$ ($d^4$).

      "correctAnswer": "(a) $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} \\approx 2.00 \\text{ V}$ (b) Metal A is better for coating iron to prevent corrosion as it acts as a sacrificial anode.",
      "solution": "(a) Using the Nernst equation: E_cell = E°_cell - (0.0591/n) × log Q. For 2Al + 3Cu²⁺ → 2Al³⁺ + 3Cu, n = 6. Q = [Al³⁺]²/[Cu²⁺]³ = (0.01)²/(0.01)³ = 10⁻⁴/10⁻⁶ = 100. So: 1.98 = E°_cell - (0.0591/6) × log 100 = E°_cell - (0.0591/6) × 2 = E°_cell - 0.0197. E°_cell = 1.98 + 0.0197 = 1.9997 V ≈ 2.00 V.\n\n(b) To prevent corrosion of iron by coating, the coating metal should act as a sacrificial anode (cathodic protection) — i.e., the coating metal should be more reactive (more easily oxidised) than iron. E°(Fe²⁺/Fe) = -0.44 V. E°(A²⁺/A) = -2.37 V → more negative → more easily oxidised → more reactive than Fe → acts as sacrificial anode. E°(B²⁺/B) = -0.14 V → less negative than Fe → less reactive → if coating is broken, Fe being more reactive would corrode faster. Therefore, Metal A provides better protection by acting as a sacrificial anode, oxidising preferentially to protect the iron underneath.",

        "solution": "(a) Given: C = 0.001 mol L⁻¹, κ = 3.905 × 10⁻⁵ S cm⁻¹. Molar conductivity: λ_m = (κ × 1000) / C = (3.905 × 10⁻⁵ × 1000) / 0.001 = 39.05 S cm² mol⁻¹. Molar conductivity at infinite dilution: CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H⁺. λ°_m(CH₃COOH) = λ°(CH₃COO⁻) + λ°(H⁺) = 40.9 + 349.6 = 390.5 S cm² mol⁻¹. Degree of dissociation: α = λ_m / λ°_m = 39.05 / 390.5 = 0.1 (i.e., 10% dissociation).\n\n(b) An electrochemical cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). It generates electricity from the energy released during a spontaneous redox reaction (in a galvanic/voltaic cell) or uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (in an electrolytic cell). When the external potential applied to an electrochemical cell exceeds the E°_cell of the cell, the direction of the cell reaction is reversed. The galvanic cell is converted into an electrolytic cell, and electrolysis occurs — the non-spontaneous reverse reaction is forced to occur. This principle is the basis of recharging batteries and electrolytic refining of metals."

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a)(i) Mn forms pπ–dπ bonds with O allowing +7 state; F has no d-orbitals so cannot form pπ–dπ bonds, limiting Mn to +4. (ii) Cr³⁺ (3d³) is more stable than Cr²⁺ (3d⁴), so Cr²⁺ readily loses an electron, acting as a strong reducing agent. (iii) Zn²⁺ has completely filled 3d¹⁰, no d–d transitions possible; Cu²⁺ has 3d⁹ with one vacancy, d–d transitions absorb visible light making it coloured. (b)(i) 2K₂MnO₄ + 2H₂O (ii) 2Cr³⁺ + 3I₂ + 7H₂O",
      "solution": "(a)(i) Manganese can form pπ–dπ bonds with oxygen (using the 2p orbitals of oxygen and 3d orbitals of Mn), which stabilise high oxidation states, allowing Mn to reach +7 (as in KMnO₄). Fluorine, being the most electronegative element and having no d-orbitals, cannot form pπ–dπ bonds. Therefore, with fluorine, Mn can only achieve the highest oxidation state of +4 (as in MnF₄).\n\n(ii) The electronic configuration of Cr²⁺ is [Ar] 3d⁴ and that of Cr³⁺ is [Ar] 3d³. The 3d³ configuration of Cr³⁺ is relatively more stable (half-filled t₂g subshell in octahedral field). Due to the greater stability of the +3 oxidation state, Cr²⁺ has a strong tendency to lose one more electron and get oxidised to Cr³⁺. Therefore, Cr²⁺ acts as a strong reducing agent.\n\n(iii) Zn²⁺: configuration [Ar] 3d¹⁰ — the d-subshell is completely filled. No d–d electronic transition is possible. Therefore, Zn²⁺ salts do not absorb visible light and appear white (colourless). Cu²⁺: configuration [Ar] 3d⁹ — the d-subshell is partially filled (one vacancy). d–d transitions are possible, absorbing visible light, making Cu²⁺ salts coloured (blue-green).\n\n(b)(i) 2MnO₂ + 4KOH + O₂ → 2K₂MnO₄ + 2H₂O (MnO₂ is oxidised to potassium manganate).\n(ii) Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6I⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 3I₂ + 7H₂O. Dichromate ion is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic medium, oxidising I⁻ to I₂ while Cr is reduced from +6 to +3.",

        "correctAnswer": "(i) Mn shows maximum oxidation states (+2 to +7) due to 7 electrons (3d⁵4s²) available for bonding. (ii) Cr has the highest melting point due to 6 unpaired electrons forming strong metallic bonds. (iii) Sc shows only +3 oxidation state. (iv) Mn³⁺ is a strong oxidizing agent because Mn²⁺ (3d⁵) has extra-stable half-filled configuration.",
        "solution": "(i) Manganese (Mn) shows the maximum number of oxidation states (+2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7). Mn has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s². It has a total of 7 electrons (5 in 3d + 2 in 4s) that can participate in bonding/oxidation. Since it is at the middle of the 3d series, it can utilise all these electrons in various oxidation states from +2 to +7.\n\n(ii) Chromium (Cr) has the highest melting point among 3d transition elements. Cr has the configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹, giving 6 unpaired electrons (5 from 3d + 1 from 4s) that participate in the formation of strong metallic bonds. The greater the number of unpaired electrons contributing to metallic bonding, the higher the melting point.\n\n(iii) Scandium (Sc) shows only the +3 oxidation state. Sc has the configuration [Ar] 3d¹ 4s². It loses all 3 electrons (1 from 3d and 2 from 4s) to achieve the stable noble gas configuration of Ar. The +3 state is the only oxidation state exhibited by Sc.\n\n(iv) Mn (Manganese) is a strong oxidizing agent in the +3 oxidation state. Mn³⁺ (3d⁴) readily gets reduced to Mn²⁺ (3d⁵) because the 3d⁵ configuration is an extra-stable half-filled configuration. This tendency to gain stability by acquiring the half-filled d⁵ configuration drives Mn³⁺ to act as a strong oxidizing agent."

CH₃COOH (Acetic acid) does not reduce Tollen's reagent — no silver mirror formed.\n\n(c) CH₃CHO (Ethanal) has the lowest boiling point as it is a carbonyl compound with only weak dipole–dipole interactions (no O–H hydrogen bonding). CH₃CH₂OH (Ethanol) has a higher boiling point than ethanal due to strong O–H···O hydrogen bonding between alcohol molecules. CH₃COOH (Acetic acid) has the highest boiling point because carboxylic acids form dimers through two strong O–H···O=C hydrogen bonds, requiring the most energy to separate.

        "solution": "(a) In Wolff–Kishner reduction, a carbonyl group (–C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone is reduced to a –CH₂– group.

      "solution": "(a)(i) In both $NH_4^+$ and $NH_3$, nitrogen is $sp^3$ hybridised. However, in $NH_3$ there is one lone pair which causes lone pair–bond pair (lp–bp) repulsion, reducing the bond angle to $107°$. In $NH_4^+$, there is no lone pair, so only bp–bp repulsions exist, giving a bond angle of $109°28'$.\n\n(a)(ii) Due to the inert pair effect, the stability of the +4 oxidation state increases down the group (S → Se → Te). $TeO_2$ has a more stable lower oxidation state and hence has less tendency to be oxidised further, making it a poor reducing agent. Therefore, reducing character decreases from $SO_2$ to $TeO_2$.\n\n(a)(iii) In $HClO_4$, the oxidation state of Cl is $+7$, and in $HClO$ it is $+1$.

        "correctAnswer": "(a)(i) 2,4,6-tribromoaniline + 3HBr\n(a)(ii) Anilinium chloride $C_6H_5\\overset{+}{N}H_3Cl^-$\n(a)(iii) Acetanilide ($C_6H_5NHCOCH_3$)\n(b) $(CH_3)_3N < C_2H_5NH_2 < C_2H_5OH$\n(c) Use Hinsberg's reagent: $(CH_3)_2NH$ reacts, $(CH_3)_3N$ does not.",
        "solution": "(a)(i) Aniline + $Br_2$ water:\n$C_6H_5NH_2 + 3Br_2 \\xrightarrow{H_2O}$ 2,4,6-tribromoaniline $+ 3HBr$\nThe $-NH_2$ group strongly activates the ring, causing tribromination at ortho and para positions.\n\n(a)(ii) Aniline + HCl:\n$C_6H_5NH_2 + HCl \\longrightarrow C_6H_5\\overset{+}{N}H_3Cl^-$ (Anilinium chloride)\nAniline acts as a base and accepts a proton from HCl.\n\n(a)(iii) Aniline + $(CH_3CO)_2O$ / pyridine:\n$C_6H_5NH_2 + (CH_3CO)_2O \\xrightarrow{Py} C_6H_5NHCOCH_3 + CH_3COOH$\nAcetanilide is formed by acetylation.\n\n(b) Increasing order of boiling points:\n$(CH_3)_3N < C_2H_5NH_2 < C_2H_5OH$\nReason: Ethanol has the highest boiling point due to strong hydrogen bonding. Ethylamine forms hydrogen bonds but weaker than alcohol. Trimethylamine cannot form H-bonds (no N–H), so it has the lowest boiling point.\n\n(c) Chemical test using Hinsberg's reagent ($C_6H_5SO_2Cl$ — benzenesulphonyl chloride):\n- $(CH_3)_2NH$ (secondary amine) reacts with Hinsberg's reagent to form a sulphonamide product (insoluble in NaOH):\n$(CH_3)_2NH + C_6H_5SO_2Cl \\longrightarrow (CH_3)_2N-SO_2-C_6H_5 + HCl$\n- $(CH_3)_3N$ (tertiary amine) does not react with Hinsberg's reagent (no N–H bond available).\nThis difference in reactivity distinguishes the two compounds.",
