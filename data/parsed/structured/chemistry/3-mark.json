      "correctAnswer": "Copper extraction: Ore is concentrated, roasted to oxide, then reduced using carbon; blister copper obtained by refining.",
      "solution": "The main ore of copper is copper pyrite (CuFeS₂). The extraction involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Concentration of Ore — The ore is crushed and concentrated by the froth flotation method, which separates the sulphide ore from gangue (silica, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Roasting — The concentrated ore is roasted in a furnace to convert sulphides to oxides: $$2\\text{CuFeS}_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Cu}_2\\text{S} + 2\\text{FeS} + \\text{SO}_2$$\n\nStep 3: Smelting (Reduction) — The roasted ore is mixed with coke and silica (SiO₂) and smelted in a blast furnace. FeO combines with SiO₂ to form slag (FeSiO₃), which is removed. The remaining Cu₂S is converted to blister copper: $$2\\text{Cu}_2\\text{S} + 3\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cu}_2\\text{O} + 2\\text{SO}_2$$ $$2\\text{Cu}_2\\text{O} + \\text{Cu}_2\\text{S} \\rightarrow 6\\text{Cu} + \\text{SO}_2$$ The copper obtained is called blister copper (~98% pure) due to its blistered surface from SO₂ gas.\n\nStep 4: Refining — Blister copper is purified by electrolytic refining: Anode: Impure copper (blister copper), Cathode: Pure copper strip, Electrolyte: Acidified CuSO₄ solution. Pure copper deposits at cathode; impurities collect as anode mud.",

      "correctAnswer": "Methyl bromide reacts with NaOH via S_N2 mechanism, forming methanol and NaBr; involves one-step nucleophilic attack.",
      "solution": "The reaction of methyl bromide (CH₃Br) with aqueous NaOH proceeds via the S_N2 (Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution) mechanism.\n\nOverall Reaction: $$\\text{CH}_3\\text{Br} + \\text{NaOH (aq)} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{OH} + \\text{NaBr}$$\n\nMechanism (Single-step, concerted):\n1. Nucleophile: OH⁻ (strong nucleophile from NaOH) attacks the electrophilic carbon (carbon bearing the leaving group Br⁻) from the back side (180° to the C–Br bond).\n2. Transition State: A trigonal bipyramidal transition state is formed where the carbon is simultaneously bonded to OH⁻ (partially) and Br⁻ (partially): $$\\text{HO}^- + \\text{CH}_3\\text{Br} \\rightarrow [\\delta^-\\text{HO}---\\text{CH}_3---\\text{Br}^{\\delta^-}]^\\ddagger \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{OH} + \\text{Br}^-$$\n3. Inversion of configuration (Walden inversion) occurs at the carbon centre.\n4. Rate law: Rate = $k[\\text{CH}_3\\text{Br}][\\text{OH}^-]$ → second-order kinetics (bimolecular).\n\nFor CH₃Br, only S_N2 occurs (no tertiary carbon, no carbocation stabilisation, so S_N1 is not possible).",

      "solution": "Lucas Reagent: A mixture of concentrated HCl and anhydrous ZnCl₂.\n\nPrinciple: Lucas reagent converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides (which are insoluble in the reagent), producing turbidity (cloudiness). The reaction proceeds via carbocation formation (S_N1 mechanism), so the reactivity order depends on carbocation stability. $$\\text{R–OH} + \\text{HCl} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ZnCl}_2} \\text{R–Cl} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nResults:\n- Tertiary alcohol (e.g., (CH₃)₃COH): Immediate turbidity (solution turns cloudy at once) — instantaneous.\n- Secondary alcohol (e.g., (CH₃)₂CHOH): Turbidity appears within 5 minutes.\n- Primary alcohol (e.g., CH₃CH₂OH): No turbidity at room temperature; reacts only on heating.\n\nExplanation: Tertiary carbocations form most easily → fastest reaction. Secondary carbocations form less easily → moderate rate. Primary alcohols cannot easily form primary carbocations → no turbidity at room temperature.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Lanthanide contraction is the gradual decrease in ionic radius among lanthanides; causes similarities between 4d and 5d transition series.",
      "solution": "Lanthanide Contraction: As we move across the lanthanide series (Ce to Lu, Z = 58–71), each element adds one electron to the 4f orbitals while the nuclear charge increases by 1. The 4f electrons have poor shielding effect (due to diffuse and poorly shielding f-orbitals). As a result, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons increases progressively. This causes a gradual but steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii across the lanthanide series. This phenomenon is called lanthanide contraction.\n\nConsequences of Lanthanide Contraction:\n1. Similarity between 4d and 5d transition series elements: The contraction in lanthanide series nearly offsets the expected increase in atomic radii going from 4d to 5d elements. This makes pairs like Zr–Hf, Nb–Ta, Mo–W nearly identical in size, making their separation very difficult.\n2. Basicity of lanthanide hydroxides: As ionic radius decreases across the series, the covalent character of M–OH bond increases, and basicity of $\\text{Ln(OH)}_3$ decreases from La(OH)₃ to Lu(OH)₃.\n3. Stability of complexes: Smaller lanthanide ions form more stable complexes due to higher charge density.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Froth flotation involves mixing crushed ore with oil and water; air bubbles lift ore particles to surface for collection.",
      "solution": "Principle: Froth flotation is based on the difference in the wettability of ore particles and gangue by water. Ore particles (sulphide ores) are preferentially wetted by oil (hydrophobic) and not by water. Gangue particles are preferentially wetted by water (hydrophilic) and not by oil.\n\nProcess:\n1. The finely powdered ore is added to a large tank containing water and pine oil (or other collectors like xanthates).\n2. A vigorous current of air is blown through the mixture to create froth/foam.\n3. The oil-coated ore particles (sulphide ore) attach to the air bubbles and rise to the surface with the froth.\n4. The gangue particles settle to the bottom (they are wetted by water and are heavier).\n5. The froth carrying ore particles is skimmed off, and the ore is filtered and dried.\n\nDepressants: Chemicals like NaCN or starch can be used to selectively depress certain minerals (e.g., ZnS) while allowing others (PbS) to float, enabling selective separation.\n\nApplication: Particularly useful for sulphide ores like galena (PbS), copper pyrite (CuFeS₂), zinc blende (ZnS).",

      "solution": "Green Chemistry is defined as the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. It was developed by Paul Anastas and John Warner.\n\nImportance of Green Chemistry in Chemical Synthesis:\n1. Prevention of waste: Designing syntheses that generate little or no waste, avoiding end-of-pipe treatment.\n2. Atom economy: Maximising the incorporation of all starting materials into the final product (100% atom utilisation).\n3. Safer chemicals: Designing chemical products that are fully effective yet have little or no toxicity to living organisms.\n4. Safer solvents: Replacing hazardous solvents with safer alternatives (e.g., water as a reaction medium, supercritical CO₂).\n5. Energy efficiency: Conducting reactions at ambient temperature and pressure to reduce energy consumption.\n6. Renewable feedstocks: Using raw materials derived from renewable resources (biomass) rather than petroleum.\n7. Catalysis: Using catalytic reagents (in small amounts, selective) rather than stoichiometric reagents.\n8. Reducing derivatives: Minimising the use of protecting groups that require additional reagents.\n\nExamples: Use of H₂O₂ instead of Cl₂ as an oxidising agent in bleaching. Use of bio-catalysts (enzymes) for stereoselective synthesis.",

      "correctAnswer": "Valence bond theory postulates hybridisation of orbitals, formation of coordinate bonds, and predicts geometry of complexes.",
      "solution": "The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) of coordination compounds was developed by Linus Pauling. Main postulates:\n\n1. Hybridisation: The central metal atom/ion uses a definite set of hybrid orbitals (formed from atomic orbitals) to form bonds with ligands. The type of hybridisation determines the geometry of the complex.\n\n2. Coordinate Bond Formation: Ligands donate lone pairs of electrons to the empty hybrid orbitals of the metal, forming coordinate (dative) covalent bonds. The metal acts as a Lewis acid and ligands act as Lewis bases.\n\n3. Inner and Outer Orbital Complexes: Inner orbital complexes (low-spin) use inner (n–1)d orbitals for hybridisation → formed with strong field ligands. Outer orbital complexes (high-spin) use outer nd orbitals for hybridisation → formed with weak field ligands.\n\n4. Magnetic Properties: The magnetic nature of complexes is predicted from the number of unpaired electrons in the metal ion after hybridisation. Complexes with unpaired electrons → paramagnetic. Complexes with all electrons paired → diamagnetic.\n\n5. Geometry from Hybridisation: $sp^3$ → Tetrahedral, $dsp^2$ → Square planar, $sp^3d^2$ or $d^2sp^3$ → Octahedral.\n\nExample: $[\\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$: Ni²⁺ ($3d^8$) undergoes $dsp^2$ hybridisation with CN⁻ (strong field) → square planar, diamagnetic.",

      "solution": "(i) Reaction of Glucose with Bromine Water: Bromine water is a mild oxidising agent. It oxidises the aldehyde group (–CHO) of glucose (an aldose) to a carboxylic acid group (–COOH), giving gluconic acid: $$\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{11}\\text{O}_5\\text{CHO} + \\text{Br}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{11}\\text{O}_5\\text{COOH} + 2\\text{HBr}$$ $$\\text{Glucose} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Br}_2/\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} \\text{Gluconic acid}$$ This reaction also serves as a test to confirm the aldehyde group in glucose (bromine water is decolourised).\n\n(ii) Reaction of Glucose with HI: Concentrated HI is a strong reducing agent that reduces all the –OH groups in glucose stepwise: $$\\text{C}_5\\text{H}_{11}\\text{O}_5\\text{CHO} \\xrightarrow{\\text{HI}} \\text{n-Hexane (CH}_3\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3\\text{)}$$ The reaction proceeds via reduction of –OH groups and the –CHO group, ultimately giving n-hexane.

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(a) Solubility of NaCl decreases on cooling, causing precipitation. (b) Conductivity decreases because fewer ions remain in solution after precipitation.",
      "solution": "(a) Precipitation upon cooling: The solubility of NaCl in water is dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, more NaCl dissolves (higher solubility). When a saturated solution of NaCl is cooled, its solubility decreases — the solution becomes supersaturated. To restore equilibrium, the excess NaCl crystallises out (precipitates) as white solid crystals. This is the principle behind fractional crystallisation used for purification of salts.\n\n(b) Change in conductivity: Conductivity decreases after precipitation. Reason: The electrical conductivity of an ionic solution depends on the concentration of ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻) present in solution. When NaCl precipitates out, some Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are removed from the solution and form the solid lattice. Fewer ions in solution → lower ionic concentration → reduced conductivity. The relationship: Conductivity ∝ number of ions in solution.",

      "correctAnswer": "(a) Order is 2; rate quadruples when [NO₂] doubles. (b) The rate increases as concentration increases due to dependence on the second power of reactant.",

This is because the rate is proportional to $[\\text{NO}_2]^2$ (second-order dependence). Doubling the concentration: Rate increases by $2^2 = 4$ times. At higher concentrations, there are more NO₂ molecules available per unit volume, leading to a much greater frequency of effective collisions between reactant molecules, hence a significantly higher reaction rate.",

Adding NH₄Cl lowers the pH of the solution by neutralising excess OH⁻: $$\\text{NH}_4^+ + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$ This reduces the hydroxide ion concentration, shifting the equilibrium: $$\\text{Fe(OH)}_3 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\\text{OH}^-$$ The equilibrium shifts to the right, dissolving the precipitate.

In option (i), the Br is directly attached to one of the sp² carbons of the double bond, making it a vinylic halide.\n\n(b) 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene is much more reactive towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) because the three nitro groups at ortho and para positions are powerful electron-withdrawing groups. They stabilise the negatively charged Meisenheimer complex formed during the nucleophilic attack by withdrawing electron density from the ring. This greatly lowers the activation energy and makes the ipso carbon (bearing Cl) highly electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\n(c) Among the isomers of C₄H₉Cl, tert-butyl chloride has the most compact, spherical shape with the smallest surface area. Boiling point depends on the strength of intermolecular van der Waals (London dispersion) forces, which increase with surface area. Since tert-butyl chloride has the least surface area, it has the weakest van der Waals forces and therefore the lowest boiling point.",

However, for a battery to be of practical use, it should be reasonably light, compact, and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries — primary batteries and secondary batteries.\n\nIn primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use over a period of time the battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again, whereas secondary batteries are rechargeable.\n\nProduction of electricity by thermal plants is not very efficient and is a major source of pollution. To solve this problem, galvanic cells are designed such that energy of combustion of fuels is directly converted into electrical energy; these are known as fuel cells.\n\n(a) How do primary batteries differ from secondary batteries?

Secondary batteries are rechargeable — the electrode reactions are reversible and the battery can be restored to its original state by passing an electric current through it.\n\n(b) The cell potential of a mercury cell remains constant throughout its life because the overall cell reaction does not involve any ions in solution (electrolyte). Both electrode reactions involve solid or insoluble species, so the concentration of the electrolyte (KOH with HgO) does not change during discharge, keeping the cell potential constant at 1.35 V.\n\n(c) During recharging, the electrode reactions (which occurred during discharge) are reversed by applying an external electric current:\n\nAt anode (oxidation during recharge): $$\\text{PbSO}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{PbO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 + 2\\text{H}^+ + 2e^-$$\n\nAt cathode (reduction during recharge): $$\\text{PbSO}_4 + 2e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Pb} + \\text{SO}_4^{2-}$$\n\nDuring recharging, PbSO₄ deposited on both electrodes during discharge is converted back to PbO₂ (positive plate) and Pb (negative plate), and H₂SO₄ is regenerated.",

      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "(i) The $-\\text{COOH}$ group is electron-withdrawing (by inductive and resonance effects), destabilizing ortho/para attack intermediates; meta position is relatively more electron-rich, so electrophile attacks meta position. (ii) NaHSO₃ forms crystalline bisulphite adducts with aldehydes/methyl ketones that can be filtered and decomposed to regenerate pure compound. (iii) In $-\\text{COOH}$, the lone pair on OH oxygen is delocalized into C=O by resonance, reducing electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, so nucleophilic addition reactions characteristic of aldehydes/ketones do not occur.",
      "solution": "(i) The carboxyl group ($-\\text{COOH}$) is a meta-director in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The $\\text{C=O}$ of the carboxyl group is electron-withdrawing through both the inductive effect and resonance effect. When the resonance structures of the intermediate carbocation (during electrophilic attack) are drawn, the ortho and para attack intermediates place the positive charge adjacent to the electron-withdrawing $-\\text{COOH}$ group, further destabilizing these intermediates. The meta attack intermediate does not have this destabilization. Therefore, the meta position is relatively more electron-rich and the electrophile preferentially attacks the meta position, making $-\\text{COOH}$ a meta-director and a deactivating group.\n\n(ii) Sodium bisulphite ($\\text{NaHSO}_3$) forms crystalline bisulphite adducts with aldehydes and methyl ketones through nucleophilic addition:\n$$\\text{R-CHO} + \\text{NaHSO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{R-CH(OH)SO}_3\\text{Na}$$\nThese adducts are crystalline solids insoluble in excess sodium bisulphite solution and can be easily filtered. The adduct is then decomposed by treatment with dilute acid (or dilute alkali) to regenerate the pure aldehyde or ketone.\n\n(iii) In carboxylic acids ($-\\text{COOH}$), the carbonyl carbon ($\\text{C=O}$) is directly bonded to a hydroxyl group ($-\\text{OH}$). The lone pair of electrons on the oxygen of the $-\\text{OH}$ group is delocalized into the $\\text{C=O}$ group through resonance, increasing the electron density on the carbonyl carbon. This makes the carbonyl carbon of $-\\text{COOH}$ less electrophilic (less susceptible to nucleophilic attack) compared to the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones. Therefore, carboxylic acids do not undergo typical carbonyl reactions such as nucleophilic addition reactions with HCN, Grignard reagents, etc.",

      "solution": "(A) The 2,4-DNP test (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine test) is given by compounds with a free carbonyl group (aldehydes and ketones). Although glucose contains an aldehyde group (–CHO), in solution it exists predominantly in the cyclic hemiacetal form (pyranose form), where the –CHO group is involved in intramolecular hemiacetal formation with the C-5 hydroxyl group. Since the free –CHO group is not freely available, glucose does not give the 2,4-DNP test.\n\n(B) The two strands of DNA are held together by specific hydrogen bonding between complementary nitrogenous bases according to Chargaff's rules:\n- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) via 2 hydrogen bonds (A=T)\n- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) via 3 hydrogen bonds (G≡C)\nThis specific base-pairing means that wherever one strand has A, the other must have T, and wherever one has G, the other must have C. The sequences are therefore complementary (each strand dictates the sequence of the other) but not identical (they run antiparallel and have different base sequences).\n\n(C) Although both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides of glucose, they differ in the type of glucose monomer and glycosidic linkage:\n- Starch: α-D-glucose monomer, α(1→4) glycosidic bonds, helical (amylose) or branched (amylopectin) structure\n- Cellulose: β-D-glucose monomer, β(1→4) glycosidic bonds, linear unbranched fibres\nThe difference in the anomeric configuration (α vs β) at C-1 of glucose leads to completely different three-dimensional structures and hence different physical and chemical properties.",

This is because:\n1. Fluorine is the most electronegative element and has no d-orbitals in its valence shell (it is in Period 2).\n2. The other halogens (Cl, Br, I) can form multiple oxoacids because they can expand their octet using available d-orbitals and use various oxidation states.\n3. Fluorine, lacking d-orbitals, cannot expand its octet beyond 8 electrons, so it cannot form higher oxoacids like $\\text{HXO}_2$, $\\text{HXO}_3$, $\\text{HXO}_4$.\n4. Additionally, fluorine is not stable in positive oxidation states (it is always –1 in compounds), except in HOF where it is formally +1.\n\n(C) Noble gases are monatomic and the only intermolecular forces acting between their atoms are weak London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces). The magnitude of these forces depends on the polarisability of the atoms, which in turn depends on the atomic size (number of electrons):\n\n$$\\text{He} < \\text{Ne} < \\text{Ar} < \\text{Kr} < \\text{Xe} < \\text{Rn}$$\n\nAs we go from He to Rn, atomic size increases, polarisability increases, London dispersion forces increase, and therefore boiling points increase progressively.",

      "solution": "(A) For heterogeneous reactions (reactions involving solids/liquids), the reaction occurs at the surface of the reactant. When the surface area is reduced (e.g., using larger lumps instead of a powder), fewer reactant molecules are exposed and available for collision. Hence, the frequency of effective collisions decreases, leading to a decrease in the rate of reaction.\n\n(B) A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy ($E_a$). This allows a greater fraction of reactant molecules to possess sufficient energy to react, increasing the frequency of effective collisions. Therefore, the rate of reaction increases. Note: for a reversible reaction, a catalyst increases the rates of both forward and reverse reactions equally, so it does not change the equilibrium position — equilibrium is reached faster.\n\n(C) According to the Arrhenius equation:\n$$k = A \\cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$$\nWhen temperature increases:\n1. The kinetic energy of molecules increases, so more molecules possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.\n2. The frequency of effective collisions increases.\n3.

      "solution": "(i) $(CH_3)_3C - I$ is more reactive towards $S_N1$. In $S_N1$ reactions, the rate depends on the stability of the carbocation intermediate.

The reactivity depends on the ease of departure of the leaving group. $I^-$ is a better leaving group than $Br^-$ (weaker C–I bond, larger and more polarisable $I^-$).

      "solution": "(a) The osmotic pressure method is preferred because:\n- Pressure measurement is carried out at room temperature, so there is no risk of degradation of heat-sensitive macromolecules.\n- Molarity of the solution is used instead of molality, which is easier to measure for solutions of large molecules.\n- The magnitude of osmotic pressure is very large even for very dilute solutions of macromolecules (compared to other colligative properties like elevation in boiling point or depression in freezing point), making it easier to measure accurately.\n\n(b) The solubility of gases in liquids decreases with increase in temperature (Henry's Law).

      "solution": "(a) For $\\text{Mn}^{3+}/\\text{Mn}^{2+}$: Mn²⁺ has a half-filled d-orbital (3d⁵), which is an extra stable configuration. Therefore, Mn³⁺ has a strong tendency to get reduced to the stable Mn²⁺ → large positive $E°$.\nFor $\\text{Fe}^{3+}/\\text{Fe}^{2+}$: Fe³⁺ has a half-filled d-orbital (3d⁵) configuration, making Fe³⁺ itself the more stable species. Fe³⁺ does not have as strong a tendency to get reduced as Mn³⁺. Therefore, $E°$ for Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ is small and positive.\nConclusion: $E°(\\text{Mn}^{3+}/\\text{Mn}^{2+}) \\gg E°(\\text{Fe}^{3+}/\\text{Fe}^{2+})$ because Fe³⁺ is more stable than Mn³⁺.\n\n(b) Enthalpy of atomisation depends on the strength of metallic bonds, which depends on the number of unpaired electrons available for metallic bonding.\n- Fe (Z=26): [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s² → 6 unpaired electrons available for bonding.\n- Cu (Z=29): [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ → only 1 unpaired electron for bonding.\nSince iron has a greater number of unpaired electrons, its metallic bonds are stronger, and therefore iron has a higher enthalpy of atomisation than copper.\n\n(c) Transition metal compounds are coloured due to d-d electronic transitions.\n- Sc³⁺ (Z=21): Electronic configuration = [Ar] 3d⁰ → no d-electrons. d-d transition is impossible. Therefore Sc³⁺ is colourless.\n- Ti³⁺ (Z=22): Electronic configuration = [Ar] 3d¹ → one d-electron is present. d-d transition is possible. The electron absorbs visible light and gets excited. Therefore Ti³⁺ is coloured (violet).",

      "solution": "**(a) Type of isomerism:**\n\nThe complex $[Co(NH_3)_5(SCN)]^{2+}$ exhibits **linkage isomerism**, because the SCN⁻ ligand can coordinate through either sulfur (–SCN, thiocyanato) or nitrogen (–NCS, isothiocyanato).\n\n**(b) $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ is paramagnetic while $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$ is diamagnetic:**\n\nIn both complexes, nickel is in +2 oxidation state with configuration $3d^8$, containing **2 unpaired electrons**.\n\n- **CN⁻** is a **strong field ligand** — it forces the pairing of electrons. The electron density is pushed, causing pairing of the $d$-electrons. Hence $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$ has **no unpaired electrons** → **diamagnetic**.\n- **Cl⁻** is a **weak field ligand** — it does not cause pairing. Hence $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ retains **2 unpaired electrons** → **paramagnetic**.\n\n**(c) Low spin tetrahedral complexes rarely observed:**\n\nIn tetrahedral complexes, the energy gap ($\\Delta_t$) between the two sets of $d$-orbitals ($e$ and $t_2$) is very small — approximately $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the octahedral splitting ($\\Delta_o$). Because of this very small energy gap, electrons always occupy higher energy levels rather than pairing, so low spin configurations are very rarely achieved in tetrahedral complexes.",

      "solution": "(i) Lyophilic sols are colloidal sols formed directly by combining substances like gum, gelatine, starch, and rubber with a suitable liquid (the dispersion medium). They are quite stable and cannot be coagulated easily because there is a strong affinity between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium.\n\n(ii) The combination of two layers of opposite charges surrounding colloidal particles is called the Helmholtz electrical double layer. The first layer of ions is firmly held (fixed layer) and the second layer is mobile (diffused layer). The potential difference between the fixed layer and the diffused layer is called the zeta potential or electrokinetic potential. It is responsible for the stability of colloidal sols.\n\n(iii) Some substances (like soaps and detergents) behave as normal strong electrolytes at low concentrations but exhibit colloidal behaviour at higher concentrations due to the formation of aggregates called micelles. These are known as associated colloids. The minimum concentration above which micelle formation begins is called the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC).",

Impure nickel is heated in a stream of CO at about 330–350 K to form volatile nickel tetracarbonyl [Ni(CO)₄], which is then decomposed at higher temperature (~450–470 K) to give pure nickel: Ni + 4CO → Ni(CO)₄ → Ni + 4CO.\n\n(ii) Alumina (Al₂O₃) has a very high melting point (~2323 K). It is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na₃AlF₆), which lowers the melting point of the mixture to about 1140 K and also increases the electrical conductivity of the melt, making electrolysis feasible and economical.\n\n(iii) Limestone (CaCO₃) acts as a flux. It decomposes on heating to give CaO, which then reacts with the silica (SiO₂) impurity present in the ore to form calcium silicate (CaSiO₃) slag, which is immiscible with the molten iron and can be easily removed: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂; CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃ (slag).",

      "solution": "(i) As we move down Group 16, the stability of the higher oxidation state decreases. Sulphur (S) is more stable in the +6 oxidation state, so SO₂ (S in +4 state) tends to get oxidised to the +6 state, acting as a reducing agent. Tellurium (Te) is more stable in the +4 oxidation state, so TeO₂ (Te in +4 state) tends to get reduced, acting as an oxidizing agent.\n\n(ii) Nitrogen does not form pentahalide because it lacks d-orbitals in its valence shell (n = 2). To form 5 bonds, the central atom needs to expand its octet, which requires d-orbitals. Since nitrogen has no d-orbitals available, it cannot form NX₅.\n\n(iii) In interhalogen compounds like ICl, the I–Cl bond is weaker and more polar than the I–I bond in I₂. The bond dissociation energy of I–Cl is lower than that of I–I, making ICl more reactive. Also, the polarity of the I–Cl bond facilitates reactions with both nucleophiles and electrophiles.",

(ii) The dimethylammonium ion is better solvated by water through hydrogen bonding than the trimethylammonium ion. (iii) Primary amines can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds via N–H bonds; tertiary amines cannot.",
      "solution": "(i) The Friedel–Crafts reaction uses AlCl₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst. Aniline (a strong Lewis base) reacts with AlCl₃ to form a salt (C₆H₅NH₃⁺·AlCl₄⁻). This positive charge on the nitrogen atom strongly deactivates the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution. As a result, aniline does not undergo the Friedel–Crafts reaction.\n\n(ii) In aqueous solution, the basicity depends on the +I effect of alkyl groups and solvation of the conjugate acid by water through hydrogen bonding. Although (CH₃)₃N has a greater +I effect than (CH₃)₂NH, the trimethylammonium ion has fewer N–H bonds available for hydrogen bonding with water compared to the dimethylammonium ion. Therefore, the cation of (CH₃)₂NH is better solvated, making (CH₃)₂NH more basic than (CH₃)₃N in aqueous solution.\n\n(iii) Primary amines (R–NH₂) have two N–H bonds and can form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds, requiring more energy to overcome these interactions. Tertiary amines (R₃N) have no N–H bond and therefore cannot form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. As a result, more energy is required to separate primary amine molecules, giving them a higher boiling point than tertiary amines.",

The doctor diagnosed that Mr. Singh was suffering from acidity and prescribed some medicines. Mr. Khanna advised him to eat home-made food and change his lifestyle by doing yoga, meditation and some physical exercise. Mr. Singh followed his friend's advice and after a few days he started feeling better.\n\nAfter reading the above passage, answer the following:\n(i) What are the values (at least two) displayed by Mr. Khanna?\n(ii) What are antacids?

      "solution": "(i) p-Nitrophenol is more acidic because the $-NO_2$ group has $-I$ and $-M$ (electron-withdrawing) effects, which stabilise the phenoxide ion formed after loss of proton. The $-CH_3$ group in p-methylphenol has $+I$ and $+M$ effects, which destabilise the phenoxide ion, making it less acidic.\n\n(ii) Due to resonance in phenol, the C–O bond acquires partial double bond character. The lone pair on oxygen is delocalized into the benzene ring, giving the C–O bond partial double bond character. In methanol, no such resonance exists. Therefore, the C–O bond in phenol is shorter than in methanol.\n\n(iii) Since $(CH_3)_3CBr$ is a tertiary alkyl halide, the bulky base/nucleophile $CH_3O^-$ cannot easily attack the highly hindered tertiary carbon (steric hindrance). Therefore, it preferentially undergoes elimination reaction (E2) to give 2-methylpropene as the major product, with methyl tert-butyl ether as the minor product:\n$$(CH_3)_3C - Br + CH_3O^-Na^+ \\longrightarrow H_3C - C(=CH_2) - CH_3 + NaBr + CH_3OH$$",
