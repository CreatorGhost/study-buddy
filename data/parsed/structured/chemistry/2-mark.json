      "question": "Define F-centres. How does their presence affect the color of alkali halides?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "F-centres are vacancies in the crystal lattice occupied by electrons; their presence imparts color to alkali halides.",
      "solution": "F-centres (Farbe centres, from German for 'colour') are anion vacancies in a crystal lattice that are occupied by electrons to maintain electrical neutrality. They are created when an alkali halide (e.g., NaCl) is heated in an atmosphere of its constituent alkali metal vapour (e.g., Na vapour). Extra Na atoms ionise; Na⁺ ions occupy lattice sites and the released electrons occupy anion vacancies. The trapped electrons can absorb visible light and get excited to higher energy levels. The complementary colour of the absorbed light is emitted/transmitted, imparting colour to the crystal. E.g., NaCl heated in Na vapour → yellow colour; KCl heated in K vapour → violet colour.",

      "question": "Why does increasing the temperature generally increase the rate of a chemical reaction?",
      "options": null,
      "correctAnswer": "Increase in temperature raises kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more effective collisions and thus higher reaction rate.",
      "solution": "Increasing temperature affects the reaction rate in two ways: 1. Increased kinetic energy: Molecules move faster, leading to a greater frequency of collisions per unit time. 2. More molecules exceed activation energy: As temperature rises, a larger fraction of molecules possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (Eₐ), as described by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. These molecules can undergo effective (fruitful) collisions. According to the Arrhenius equation: $$k = A \\cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$$ As $T$ increases, $e^{-E_a/RT}$ increases, so $k$ (rate constant) increases, and hence the reaction rate increases. A rule of thumb: For every 10°C rise in temperature, the rate approximately doubles.",

      "solution": "Transition metals have partially filled d-orbitals. In the presence of ligands, the d-orbitals split into two sets of different energy levels (crystal field splitting): $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ (in an octahedral field). When visible light falls on a transition metal compound, electrons in the lower energy d-orbitals absorb photons of specific wavelength and are excited to higher energy d-orbitals — this is called a d–d transition. The complementary colour of the absorbed light is transmitted/reflected, giving the compound its characteristic colour. Example: $[\\text{Cu(H}_2\\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$ absorbs red light and appears blue. Note: Zn²⁺ compounds are colourless because Zn²⁺ has a completely filled d¹⁰ configuration — no d–d transitions possible.",

      "solution": "When a non-volatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, the vapour pressure of the solvent decreases (as given by Raoult's law, since $x_{\\text{solvent}} < 1$). A liquid boils when its vapour pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Since the vapour pressure is lowered, a higher temperature is needed to reach atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the boiling point of the solution is higher than that of the pure solvent. This phenomenon is called: Elevation of Boiling Point (Ebullioscopy). The mathematical relation: $$\\Delta T_b = K_b \\cdot m$$ where $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant and $m$ is the molality of the solution.",

      "solution": "Correct explanation: NH₃ (boiling point: –33°C) forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (N–H···N) due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen and the presence of a lone pair. This requires significantly more energy to overcome. PH₃ (boiling point: –87°C) cannot form hydrogen bonds because phosphorus is not electronegative enough. It is held together only by weak van der Waals forces. Despite having a higher molar mass (and thus stronger London dispersion forces), PH₃ has a lower boiling point than NH₃ because hydrogen bonding in NH₃ is a much stronger intermolecular force. Therefore: NH₃ has a higher boiling point than PH₃, not lower.",

At the end point, when the reducing agent is completely consumed, the addition of even one extra drop of KMnO₄ imparts a permanent pale pink/violet colour to the solution.

Greater stability of the conjugate base means greater acid strength, so phenol is a stronger acid than alcohols.\n\n(ii) As branching in the alkyl chain increases, the shape of the molecule becomes more spherical and compact, which reduces the surface area available for intermolecular contact. Decreased surface area leads to weaker London dispersion forces (Van der Waals forces) between the molecules.

These micelles remain dispersed in water (forming a colloidal solution) because the negatively charged outer surface prevents them from coalescing.\n4. When rinsed, the dirt-containing micelles are washed away with water, leaving the surface clean.\n\nSoaps also lower the surface tension of water, allowing better wetting of the surface.",
