## Section A — C++ (For candidates who opted for C++)

---

### Q1(a).
Find the correct identifiers out of the following, which can be used for naming variables, Constants or Functions in a C++ program:

`For`, `while`, `INT`, `NeW`, `delete`, `1stName`, `Add+Subtract`, `name1`

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**
`For`, `INT`, `NeW`, `name1`

**Solution:**
`For`, `INT`, `NeW`, and `name1` could be used as valid identifiers. All others are invalid for the following reasons:
- `while` — predefined keyword in C++
- `delete` — predefined keyword in C++
- `1stName` — starts with a digit (invalid identifier)
- `Add+Subtract` — contains `+` operator (special character not allowed in identifiers)

---

### Q1(b).
Observe the following program very carefully and write the names of those header file(s), which are essentially needed to compile and execute the following program successfully:

**(1 Mark)**

```cpp
typedef char STRING[80];
void main()
{
    STRING Txt[] = "We love Peace";
    int Count = 0;
    while (Txt[Count] != '\0')
        if (isalpha(Txt[Count]))
            Txt[Count++] = '@';
        else
            Txt[Count++] = '#';
    puts(Txt);
}
```

**Answer:**
`ctype.h` and `stdio.h`

**Solution:**
- `ctype.h` — required for the `isalpha()` function which checks if a character is an alphabet.
- `stdio.h` — required for the `puts()` function which outputs a string to stdout.

---

### Q1(c).
Observe the following C++ code very carefully and rewrite it after removing any/all syntactical errors with each correction underlined.

**(2 Marks)**

> **Note:** Assume all required header files are already being included in the program.

```cpp
#Define float MaxSpeed=60.5;
void main()
{
    int MySpeed
    char Alert='N';
    cin>>MySpeed;
    if MySpeed>MaxSpeed
        Alert='Y';
    cout<<Alert<<endline;
}
```

**Answer (Corrected Code):**

```cpp
#define MaxSpeed 60.5          // 3 errors corrected:
                               // #Define → #define
                               // float removed (macros don't have types)
                               // =60.5; → 60.5 (no = and no semicolon)
void main()
{
    int MySpeed;               // 1 error: missing semicolon
    char Alert='N';
    cin>>MySpeed;
    if (MySpeed > MaxSpeed)    // 1 error: condition must be in parentheses
        Alert='Y';
    cout<<Alert<<endl;         // 1 error: endline → endl
}
```

**Solution:**
The corrections made are:
1. `#Define` → `#define` (preprocessor directives are case-sensitive and lowercase)
2. `float` removed from `#define` — macro definitions do not include data types
3. `=60.5;` → `60.5` — `#define` uses replacement text, not assignment; no semicolon needed
4. `int MySpeed` → `int MySpeed;` — missing semicolon at end of declaration
5. `if MySpeed>MaxSpeed` → `if (MySpeed>MaxSpeed)` — `if` condition must be enclosed in parentheses
6. `endline` → `endl` — correct manipulator name is `endl`

---

### Q1(d).
Write the output of the following C++ program code:

**(2 Marks)**

> **Note:** Assume all required header files are already being included in the program.

```cpp
void Location(int &X, int Y=4)
{
    Y += 2;
    X += Y;
}
void main()
{
    int PX=10, PY=2;
    Location(PY);
    cout<<PX<<","<<PY<<endl;
    Location(PX, PY);
    cout<<PX<<","<<PY<<endl;
}
```

**Answer:**
```
10,8
20,8
```

**Solution:**

**First call — `Location(PY)`:**
- `X` is a reference to `PY` (value = 2), `Y` takes default value = 4
- `Y += 2` → `Y = 6`
- `X += Y` → `PY = 2 + 6 = 8`
- `PX` remains unchanged = 10
- Output: `10,8`

**Second call — `Location(PX, PY)`:**
- `X` is a reference to `PX` (value = 10), `Y = PY = 8` (passed by value)
- `Y += 2` → `Y = 10`
- `X += Y` → `PX = 10 + 10 = 20`
- `PY` is passed by value so unchanged = 8
- Output: `20,8`

---

### Q1(e).
Write the output of the following C++ program code:

**(2 Marks)**

> **Note:** Assume all required header files are already being included in the program.

```cpp
class Eval
{
    char Level;
    int Point;
public:
    Eval()
    {
        Level = 'E';
        Point = 0;
    }
    void Sink(int L)
    {
        Level -= L;
    }
    void Float(int L)
    {
        Level += L;
        Point++;
    }
    void Show()
    {
        cout<<Level<<"#"<<Point<<endl;
    }
};

void main()
{
    Eval E;
    E.Sink(3);
    E.Show();
    E.Float(7);
    E.Show();
    E.Sink(2);
    E.Show();
}
```

**Answer:**
```
B#0
I#1
G#1
```

**Solution:**
- Constructor initializes `Level = 'E'` (ASCII 69), `Point = 0`
- `E.Sink(3)`: `Level = 'E' - 3 = 69 - 3 = 66 = 'B'`; `Point = 0`
  - `E.Show()` → prints `B#0`
- `E.Float(7)`: `Level = 'B' + 7 = 66 + 7 = 73 = 'I'`; `Point = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `E.Show()` → prints `I#1`
- `E.Sink(2)`: `Level = 'I' - 2 = 73 - 2 = 71 = 'G'`; `Point = 1`
  - `E.Show()` → prints `G#1`

### Q1(f).
Study the following program and select the possible output(s) from the options (i) to (iv) following it. Also, write the maximum and the minimum values that can be assigned to the variable `VAL`.

**(2 Marks)**

> **Note:**
> - Assume all required header files are already being included in the program.
> - `random(n)` function generates an integer between 0 and n-1.

```cpp
void main()
{
    randomize();
    int VAL;
    VAL = random(3) + 2;
    char GUESS[] = "ABCDEFGHIJK";
    for (int I=1; I<=VAL; I++)
    {
        for (int J=VAL; J<=7; J++)
            cout<<GUESS[J];
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
```

| (i)      | (ii)    | (iii) | (iv)  |
|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| BCDEFGH  | CDEFGH  | EFGH  | FGHI  |
| BCDEFGH  | CDEFGH  | EFGH  | FGHI  |
|          |         | EFGH  | FGHI  |
|          |         | EFGH  | FGHI  |

**Answer:**
Outputs **(ii)** and **(iii)** are correct.

- **Minimum value of VAL:** 2
- **Maximum value of VAL:** 4

**Solution:**
- `random(3)` generates 0, 1, or 2
- So `VAL = random(3) + 2` → VAL ∈ {2, 3, 4}

**When VAL = 2:**
- Outer loop runs 2 times (I = 1, 2)
- Inner loop: J goes from 2 to 7 → prints `GUESS[2]` to `GUESS[7]` = `CDEFGH`
- Output:
  ```
  CDEFGH
  CDEFGH
  ```
  → matches option **(ii)**

**When VAL = 3:**
- Outer loop runs 3 times
- Inner loop: J goes from 3 to 7 → prints `GUESS[3]` to `GUESS[7]` = `DEFGH`
- This does not match any given option exactly.

**When VAL = 4:**
- Outer loop runs 4 times
- Inner loop: J goes from 4 to 7 → prints `GUESS[4]` to `GUESS[7]` = `EFGH`
- Output:
  ```
  EFGH
  EFGH
  EFGH
  EFGH
  ```
  → matches option **(iii)**

> **Note:** Option (i) would require VAL=1 (gives BCDEFGH twice), but VAL cannot be 1. Option (iv) requires VAL=5 which is also out of range.

## Section A — Object-Oriented Programming

---

### Q2(a).
What is a copy constructor? Give a suitable example in C++ to illustrate with its definition within a class and a declaration of an object with the help of it.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

A **copy constructor** is a member function of a class (also known as an overloaded constructor) in which an object of the same class is passed as a reference parameter. It is used to initialize one object using another object of the same class.

```cpp
class Copy
{
    int i;
public:
    Copy()
    {
        i = 0;
    }
    Copy(Copy &c)    // Copy Constructor
    {
        i = c.i;
    }
};

void main()
{
    Copy c1;
    Copy c2(c1);    // Copy Constructor is invoked
}
```

---

### Q2(b).
Observe the following C++ code and answer the questions (i) and (ii):

```cpp
class Passenger
{
    long PNR;
    char Name[20];
public:
    Passenger()                      // Function 1
    {
        cout<<"Ready"<<endl;
    }
    void Book(long P, char N[])      // Function 2
    {
        PNR = P;
        strcpy(Name, N);
    }
    void Print()                     // Function 3
    {
        cout<<PNR<<Name<<endl;
    }
    ~Passenger()                     // Function 4
    {
        cout<<"Booking cancelled!"<<endl;
    }
};
```

#### Q2(b)(i).
Fill in the blank statements in Line 1 and Line 2 to execute Function 2 and Function 3 respectively in the following code:

**(1 Mark)**

```cpp
void main()
{
    Passenger P;
    ___________   // Line 1
    ___________   // Line 2
}   // Ends here
```

**Answer:**
```cpp
P.Book(1111111, "Ram");   // Line 1
P.Print();                // Line 2
```

---

#### Q2(b)(ii).
Which function will be executed at `} // Ends here`? What is this function referred to as?

**Answer:**
**Function 4** (`~Passenger()`) will be executed at `} // Ends here`.

**Solution:**
This function is referred to as a **destructor**. It is automatically called when the object goes out of scope (i.e., at the closing brace of `main()`). It performs cleanup operations before the object is destroyed.

---

### Q2(c).
Write the definition of a class `Photo` in C++ with the following description:

**(4 Marks)**

**Private Members:**
- `Pno` — Data member for Photo Number (an integer)
- `Category` — Data member for Photo Category (a string)
- `Exhibit` — Data member for Exhibition Gallery (a string)
- `FixExhibit()` — A member function to assign Exhibition Gallery as per Category as shown in the following table:

| Category | Exhibit  |
|----------|----------|
| Antique  | Zaveri   |
| Modern   | Johnsen  |
| Classic  | Terenida |

**Public Members:**
- `Register()` — A function to allow user to enter values for `Pno`, `Category` and call `FixExhibit()` function
- `ViewAll()` — A function to display all the data members

**Answer:**

```cpp
class Photo
{
private:
    int Pno;
    char Category[20], Exhibit[20];
    void FixExhibit();
public:
    void Register();
    void ViewAll();
};

void Photo::FixExhibit()
{
    if (strcmp(Category, "Antique") == 0)
        strcpy(Exhibit, "Zaveri");
    else if (strcmp(Category, "Modern") == 0)
        strcpy(Exhibit, "Johnsen");
    else if (strcmp(Category, "Classic") == 0)
        strcpy(Exhibit, "Terenida");
}

void Photo::Register()
{
    cin >> Pno;
    gets(Category);
    FixExhibit();
}

void Photo::ViewAll()
{
    cout << Pno << Category << Exhibit << endl;
}
```

### Q2(d).
Answer the questions (i) to (iv) based on the following:

**(4 Marks)**

```cpp
class Interior
{
    int OrderId;
    char Address[20];
protected:
    float Advance;
public:
    Interior();
    void Book();
    void View();
};

class Painting : public Interior
{
    int WallArea, ColorCode;
protected:
    char Type;
public:
    Painting();
    void PBook();
    void PView();
};

class Billing : public Painting
{
    float Charges;
    void Calculate();
public:
    Billing();
    void Bill();
    void BillPrint();
};
```

#### Q2(d)(i).
Which type of Inheritance out of the following is illustrated in the above example?
- Single Level Inheritance
- Multi Level Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance

**Answer:**
**Multi Level Inheritance**

**Solution:**
`Interior` is the base class, `Painting` inherits from `Interior`, and `Billing` inherits from `Painting`. This chain of inheritance forms a multi-level hierarchy.

---

#### Q2(d)(ii).
Write the names of all the data members which are directly accessible from the member functions of class `Painting`.

**Answer:**
- `WallArea` (private to `Painting`)
- `ColorCode` (private to `Painting`)
- `Type` (protected in `Painting`)
- `Advance` (protected in `Interior`, accessible in derived class `Painting`)

> **Note:** `OrderId` and `Address` are **private** to `Interior` and are **not** directly accessible in `Painting`.

---

#### Q2(d)(iii).
Write the names of all the member functions which are directly accessible from an object of class `Billing`.

**Answer:**
The following **public** member functions are directly accessible from an object of class `Billing`:
- `Bill()` — public in `Billing`
- `BillPrint()` — public in `Billing`
- `PBook()` — public in `Painting` (inherited)
- `PView()` — public in `Painting` (inherited)
- `Book()` — public in `Interior` (inherited)
- `View()` — public in `Interior` (inherited)

> **Note:** Constructors `Billing()`, `Painting()`, `Interior()` are also invoked automatically.

---

#### Q2(d)(iv).
What will be the order of execution of the constructors, when an object of class `Billing` is declared?

**Answer:**
$$\text{Interior()} \rightarrow \text{Painting()} \rightarrow \text{Billing()}$$

**Solution:**
In multi-level inheritance, constructors are called starting from the topmost base class down to the most derived class. So `Interior()` executes first, then `Painting()`, and finally `Billing()`.

## Section A — Arrays, Stacks & Queues

---

### Q3(a).
Write the definition of a function `Change(int P[], int N)` in C++, which should change all the multiples of 10 in the array to 10 and the rest of the elements as 1.

**(2 Marks)**

For example, if an array of 10 integers is as follows:

| P[0] | P[1] | P[2] | P[3] | P[4] | P[5] | P[6] | P[7] | P[8] | P[9] |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 100  | 43   | 20   | 56   | 32   | 91   | 80   | 40   | 45   | 21   |

After executing the function, the array content should be changed as follows:

| P[0] | P[1] | P[2] | P[3] | P[4] | P[5] | P[6] | P[7] | P[8] | P[9] |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 10   | 1    | 10   | 1    | 1    | 1    | 10   | 10   | 1    | 1    |

**Answer:**

```cpp
void Change(int P[], int N)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        if (P[i] % 10 == 0)
            P[i] = 10;
        else
            P[i] = 1;
    }
}
```

### Q3(b).
A two dimensional array `ARR[50][20]` is stored in the memory along the row with each of its elements occupying 4 bytes. Find the address of the element `ARR[30][10]`, if the element `ARR[10][5]` is stored at the memory location 15000.

**(3 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**Step 1 — Find Base Address using ARR[10][5]:**

Using Row-Major formula (1-based indexing):

$$\text{Address}(ARR[I][J]) = \text{Base} + W \times [(I - LB_r) \times C + (J - LB_c)]$$

Assuming 0-based indexing:

$$15000 = \text{Base} + 4 \times [10 \times 20 + 5]$$

$$15000 = \text{Base} + 4 \times [200 + 5]$$

$$15000 = \text{Base} + 4 \times 205$$

$$15000 = \text{Base} + 820$$

$$\text{Base} = 15000 - 820 = 14180$$

**Step 2 — Find Address of ARR[30][10]:**

$$\text{Address}(ARR[30][10]) = 14180 + 4 \times [30 \times 20 + 10]$$

$$= 14180 + 4 \times [600 + 10]$$

$$= 14180 + 4 \times 610$$

$$= 14180 + 2440$$

$$= \boxed{16620}$$

> **Note:** The answer sheet uses 1-based indexing in its formula which gives Base = 14264 and final answer 16620. Both methods yield the same final address of **16620**.

### Q3(c).
Write the definition of a member function `PUSH()` in C++, to add a new book in a dynamic stack of `BOOKS` considering the following code is already included in the program:

**(4 Marks)**

```cpp
struct BOOKS
{
    char ISBN[20], TITLE[80];
    BOOKS *Link;
};

class STACK
{
    BOOKS *Top;
public:
    STACK()
    {
        Top = NULL;
    }
    void PUSH();
    void POP();
    ~STACK();
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void STACK::PUSH()
{
    BOOKS *temp;
    temp = new BOOKS;
    gets(temp->ISBN);
    gets(temp->TITLE);
    temp->Link = Top;
    Top = temp;
}
```

**Solution:**
1. A new `BOOKS` node is dynamically allocated using `new`.
2. The user enters `ISBN` and `TITLE` for the new book.
3. The new node's `Link` pointer is set to the current `Top` (linking to existing stack).
4. `Top` is updated to point to the new node (new node becomes the top of stack).

---

### Q3(d).
Write a function `REVIEW(int P[][5], int N, int M)` in C++ to display the content of a two dimensional array, with each row content in reverse order.

**(3 Marks)**

For example, if the content of array is:

```
15  12  56  45  51
13  91  92  87  63
11  23  61  46  81
```

The function should display output as:

```
51  45  56  12  15
63  87  92  91  13
81  46  61  23  11
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void REVIEW(int P[][5], int N, int M)
{
    for (int r = 0; r < N; r++)
    {
        for (int c = M-1; c >= 0; c--)
            cout << P[r][c] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- The outer loop iterates over each row from 0 to N-1.
- The inner loop iterates over each column from M-1 down to 0 (i.e., in reverse order).
- Each element is printed and a newline is added after each row.

---

### Q3(e).
Convert the following Infix expression to its equivalent Postfix expression, showing the stack contents for each step of conversion:

**(2 Marks)**

$$U * V + R / (S - T)$$

**Answer:**

Postfix Expression: **`UV*RST-/+`**

**Solution:**

The infix expression can be fully parenthesized as:

$$((U * V) + (R / (S - T)))$$

Step-by-step conversion:

| Element Scanned | Stack Contents | Postfix Expression |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| U               | (empty)        | U                  |
| *               | *              | U                  |
| V               | *              | UV                 |
| +               | +              | UV*                |
| R               | +              | UV*R               |
| /               | + /            | UV*R               |
| (               | + / (          | UV*R               |
| S               | + / (          | UV*RS              |
| -               | + / ( -        | UV*RS              |
| T               | + / ( -        | UV*RST             |
| )               | + /            | UV*RST-            |
| (end)           | (empty)        | UV*RST-/+          |

$$\boxed{UV*RST-/+}$$

### Q4(a).
Write function definition for `TOWER()` in C++ to read the content of a text file `WRITEUP.TXT`, count the presence of word `TOWER` and display the number of occurrences of this word.

**(2 Marks)**

> **Note:**
> - The word TOWER should be an independent word
> - Ignore type cases (i.e. lower/upper case)

**Example:** If the content of the file `WRITEUP.TXT` is:

> *The Tower of Hanoi is an interesting problem. Mobile phone tower is away from here. Views from EIFFEL TOWER are amazing.*

The function `TOWER()` should display: **3**

**Answer:**

```cpp
void TOWER()
{
    int COUNT = 0;
    ifstream F("WRITEUP.TXT");
    char K[20];
    while (!F.eof())
    {
        F >> K;
        if (strcmpi(K, "TOWER") == 0)
            COUNT++;
    }
    cout << COUNT;
    F.close();
}
```

**Solution:**
- The file `WRITEUP.TXT` is opened in read mode using `ifstream`.
- Words are read one by one into character array `K`.
- `strcmpi()` performs a case-insensitive comparison between each word and `"TOWER"`.
- Every match increments `COUNT`.
- The total count is displayed and the file is closed.

---

### Q4(b).
Write a definition for function `COSTLY()` in C++ to read each record of a binary file `GIFTS.DAT`, find and display those items which are priced more than 2000. Assume that the file `GIFTS.DAT` is created with the help of objects of class `GIFTS`, which is defined below:

**(3 Marks)**

```cpp
class GIFTS
{
    int CODE;
    char ITEM[20];
    float PRICE;
public:
    void Procure()
    {
        cin >> CODE;
        gets(ITEM);
        cin >> PRICE;
    }
    void View()
    {
        cout << CODE << ":" << ITEM << ":" << PRICE << endl;
    }
    float GetPrice()
    {
        return PRICE;
    }
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void COSTLY()
{
    GIFTS X;
    ifstream F("GIFTS.DAT", ios::binary);
    while (F.read((char*)&X, sizeof(X)))
    {
        if (X.GetPrice() > 2000)
            X.View();
    }
    F.close();
}
```

**Solution:**
- A `GIFTS` object `X` is created to hold each record.
- The binary file `GIFTS.DAT` is opened in binary read mode.
- Records are read one by one using `F.read()`.
- `GetPrice()` retrieves the price of each record; if it exceeds 2000, `View()` displays the record.
- The file is closed after processing.

### Q4(c).
Find the output of the following C++ code considering that the binary file `MEMBER.DAT` exists on the hard disk with records of 100 members:

**(1 Mark)**

```cpp
class MEMBER
{
    int Mno;
    char Name[20];
public:
    void In();
    void Out();
};

void main()
{
    fstream MF;
    MF.open("MEMBER.DAT", ios::binary | ios::in);
    MEMBER M;
    MF.read((char*)&M, sizeof(M));
    MF.read((char*)&M, sizeof(M));
    MF.read((char*)&M, sizeof(M));
    int POSITION = MF.tellg() / sizeof(M);
    cout << "PRESENT RECORD:" << POSITION << endl;
    MF.close();
}
```

**Answer:**
```
PRESENT RECORD:3
```

**Solution:**
- Three `read()` calls are made, each reading one `MEMBER` record.
- After 3 reads, `MF.tellg()` returns the current byte position = $3 \times \text{sizeof(MEMBER)}$.
- Dividing by `sizeof(M)` gives the record number = **3**.
- Therefore the output is `PRESENT RECORD:3`.

### Q1(a).
How is `__init__()` different from `__del__()`?

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

| Feature | `__init__()` | `__del__()` |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Type | Constructor | Destructor |
| When called | Automatically when an object is **created** | Automatically when an object goes **out of scope** or is deleted |
| Purpose | Initialize the object's attributes | Perform cleanup operations before object is destroyed |

```python
class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = 10
        print('Data:', self.data, 'created')

    def __del__(self):
        print('Data:', self.data, 'deleted')

t = Test()
del t
```

### Q1(b).
Name the function/method required to:

**(1 Mark)**

**(i)** Check if a string contains only alphabets

**Answer:** `isalpha()`

**(ii)** Give the total length of the list

**Answer:** `len()`

---

### Q1(c).
Rewrite the following code in Python after removing all syntax error(s). Underline each correction done in the code.

**(2 Marks)**

```python
def Sum(Count) #Method to find sum
S=0
for I in Range(1,Count+1):
S+=I
RETURN S
print Sum[2] #Function Call
print Sum[5]
```

**Answer (Corrected Code):**

```python
def Sum(Count):        # Error 1: missing colon ':'
    S=0
    for I in range(1,Count+1):   # Error 2: Range → range (case-sensitive)
        S+=I
    return S           # Error 3: RETURN → return (case-sensitive)

print Sum(2)           # Error 4: Sum[2] → Sum(2) (function call uses parentheses)
print Sum(5)           # Error 5: Sum[5] → Sum(5)
```

**Corrections made:**
1. `def Sum(Count)` → `def Sum(Count):` — function definition requires a colon
2. `Range` → `range` — Python is case-sensitive; built-in is lowercase `range`
3. `RETURN` → `return` — Python keywords are lowercase
4. `Sum[2]` → `Sum(2)` — functions are called with `()`, not `[]`
5. `Sum[5]` → `Sum(5)` — same correction as above

---

### Q1(d).
Find and write the output of the following Python code:

**(2 Marks)**

```python
for Name in ['John', 'Garima', 'Seema', 'Karan']:
    print Name
    if Name[0]=='S':
        break
    else:
        print 'Completed!'
print 'Well Done!'
```

**Answer:**
```
John
Completed!
Garima
Completed!
Seema
Well Done!
```

**Solution:**
- `Name = 'John'`: prints `John`, `Name[0]` is `'J'` ≠ `'S'`, so prints `Completed!`
- `Name = 'Garima'`: prints `Garima`, `Name[0]` is `'G'` ≠ `'S'`, so prints `Completed!`
- `Name = 'Seema'`: prints `Seema`, `Name[0]` is `'S'` → `break` exits the loop
- After the loop: prints `Well Done!`

> **Note:** The `else` clause of a `for` loop in Python executes only if the loop completes without hitting `break`. Since `break` is triggered, the for-else's `else` block does not run. However, the `else` here is part of the `if` inside the loop body, not the loop's `else`.

---

### Q1(e).
Find and write the output of the following Python code:

**(2 Marks)**

```python
class Emp:
    def __init__(self, code, nm):    # constructor
        self.Code = code
        self.Name = nm
    def Manip(self):
        self.Code = self.Code + 10
        self.Name = 'Karan'
    def Show(self, line):
        print self.Code, self.Name, line

s = Emp(25, 'Mamta')
s.Show(1)
s.Manip()
s.Show(2)
print s.Code + len(s.Name)
```

**Answer:**
```
25 Mamta 1
35 Karan 2
40
```

**Solution:**
- `s = Emp(25, 'Mamta')`: `Code = 25`, `Name = 'Mamta'`
- `s.Show(1)`: prints `25 Mamta 1`
- `s.Manip()`: `Code = 25 + 10 = 35`, `Name = 'Karan'`
- `s.Show(2)`: prints `35 Karan 2`
- `s.Code + len(s.Name)` = `35 + len('Karan')` = `35 + 5` = `40`

### Q1(f).
What are the possible outcome(s) executed from the following code? Also specify the maximum and minimum values that can be assigned to the variable `COUNT`.

**(2 Marks)**

```python
TEXT = "CBSEONLINE"
COUNT = random.randint(0, 3)
C = 9
while TEXT[C] != 'L':
    print TEXT[C] + TEXT[COUNT] + '*',
    COUNT = COUNT + 1
    C = C - 1
```

| (i)        | (ii)        | (iii)      | (iv)       |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| EC\*NB\*IS\* | NS\*IE\*LO\* | ES\*NE\*IO\* | LE\*NO\*ON\* |

**Answer:**
Options **(i)** and **(iii)** are the possible outcomes.

- **Minimum value of COUNT:** 0
- **Maximum value of COUNT:** 3

**Solution:**

`TEXT = "CBSEONLINE"` → indices: C=0, B=1, S=2, E=3, O=4, N=5, L=6, I=7, N=8, E=9

The loop starts at `C=9` and decrements. It stops when `TEXT[C] == 'L'` (i.e., when C=6).
So the loop runs for C = 9, 8, 7 (3 iterations).

Each iteration prints `TEXT[C] + TEXT[COUNT] + '*'`:

**When COUNT = 0** (minimum):
- Iteration 1: C=9 → `TEXT[9]='E'`, COUNT=0 → `TEXT[0]='C'` → prints `EC*`; COUNT→1, C→8
- Iteration 2: C=8 → `TEXT[8]='N'`, COUNT=1 → `TEXT[1]='B'` → prints `NB*`; COUNT→2, C→7
- Iteration 3: C=7 → `TEXT[7]='I'`, COUNT=2 → `TEXT[2]='S'` → prints `IS*`; COUNT→3, C→6
- C=6 → `TEXT[6]='L'` → loop ends
- Output: `EC*NB*IS*` → matches **(i)**

**When COUNT = 2:**
- Iteration 1: C=9 → `'E'`, COUNT=2 → `TEXT[2]='S'` → prints `ES*`; COUNT→3, C→8
- Iteration 2: C=8 → `'N'`, COUNT=3 → `TEXT[3]='E'` → prints `NE*`; COUNT→4, C→7
- Iteration 3: C=7 → `'I'`, COUNT=4 → `TEXT[4]='O'` → prints `IO*`; COUNT→5, C→6
- Output: `ES*NE*IO*` → matches **(iii)**

### Q2(a).
Illustrate the concept of inheritance with the help of a Python code.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

```python
class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        print "Base Constructor"
    def show1(self):
        print "Base class"

class Der(Base):          # Der inherits from Base
    def __init__(self):
        print "Derived Constructor"
    def show2(self):
        print "Derived class"
```

**Solution:**
Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a **derived class** (`Der`) inherits the properties and methods of a **base class** (`Base`). The derived class can access the public and protected members of the base class and can also define its own additional members.

---

### Q2(b).
What will be the output of the following Python code? Explain the `try` and `except` used in the code.

**(2 Marks)**

```python
A = 0
B = 6
print 'One'
try:
    print 'Two'
    X = B/A
    print 'Three'
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print B*2
    print 'Four'
except:
    print B*3
    print 'Five'
```

**Answer:**
```
One
Two
12
Four
```

**Solution:**
- `print 'One'` executes normally → prints `One`
- Enters the `try` block: `print 'Two'` → prints `Two`
- `X = B/A` → `X = 6/0` → raises a `ZeroDivisionError`
- `print 'Three'` is **skipped** (exception raised before it)
- The `except ZeroDivisionError:` block catches the error:
  - `print B*2` → `print 6*2` → prints `12`
  - `print 'Four'` → prints `Four`
- The second `except:` block is not executed (exception already handled)

**Explanation of `try`/`except`:**
- The `try` block contains code that might raise an exception.
- If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, execution jumps to the `except ZeroDivisionError:` block.
- The bare `except:` block handles any other exception type not caught above.
- This prevents program crashes due to runtime errors.

### Q2(c).
Write a class `PHOTO` in Python with the following specifications:

**(4 Marks)**

**Instance Attributes:**
- `Pno` — Numeric value
- `Category` — String Value
- `Exhibit` — Exhibition Gallery with String value

**Methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FixExhibit()` | Assigns Exhibition Gallery as per Category (see table below) |
| `Register()` | Allows user to enter values for `Pno`, `Category` and calls `FixExhibit()` |
| `ViewAll()` | Displays all the data members |

| Category | Exhibit  |
|----------|----------|
| Antique  | Zaveri   |
| Modern   | Johnsen  |
| Classic  | Terenida |

**Answer:**

```python
class PHOTO:
    def __init__(self):
        self.Pno = 0
        self.Category = " "
        self.Exhibit = " "

    def FixExhibit(self):
        if self.Category == "Antique":
            self.Exhibit = "Zaveri"
        elif self.Category == "Modern":
            self.Exhibit = "Johnsen"
        elif self.Category == "Classic":
            self.Exhibit = "Terenida"

    def Register(self):
        self.Pno = int(input("Enter Pno: "))
        self.Category = input("Enter Category: ")
        self.FixExhibit()

    def ViewAll(self):
        print(self.Pno, self.Category, self.Exhibit)
```

### Q2(d).
What is operator overloading with methods? Illustrate with the help of an example using a Python code.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**Operator overloading** is the ability to give extended or different meaning to a predefined operator depending on the types of its operands. Python supports operator overloading through special (dunder) methods.

```python
x = 5
y = 9
print(x + y)      # '+' here adds two integers → Output: 14

x = 'Ram'
y = 'Kumar'
print(x + y)      # '+' here concatenates two strings → Output: RamKumar
```

**Solution:**
The `+` operator is overloaded in Python:
- When used with integers or floats, it performs **arithmetic addition**.
- When used with strings, it performs **string concatenation**.
- This dual behavior is achieved through the `__add__()` dunder method internally.

---

### Q2(e).
Write a method in Python to display the elements of a list twice if it is a number, and display the element terminated with `*` if it is not a number.

**(2 Marks)**

For example, if the content of list is:
```python
MyList = ['RAMAN', '21', 'YOGRAJ', '3', 'TARA']
```
The output should be:
```
RAMAN*
2121
YOGRAJ*
33
TARA*
```

**Answer:**

```python
def meth(U):
    for x in U:
        if x.isnumeric():
            print(2 * x)
        else:
            print(x + '*')
```

**Solution:**
- `isnumeric()` returns `True` if all characters in the string are numeric digits.
- If numeric: `2 * x` repeats the string twice (e.g., `'21' * 2 = '2121'`).
- If not numeric: concatenates `'*'` at the end (e.g., `'RAMAN' + '*' = 'RAMAN*'`).

### Q3(a).
What will be the status of the following list after the fourth pass of bubble sort and fourth pass of selection sort used for arranging the following elements in **descending order**?

**(3 Marks)**

Initial list: `34, -6, 12, -3, 45, 25`

**Answer:**

**After the 4th pass of Bubble Sort (descending):**
```
45, 34, 25, 12, -3, -6
```

**After the 4th pass of Selection Sort (descending):**
```
45, 34, 25, 12, -6, -3
```

**Solution:**

**Bubble Sort (descending) — each pass bubbles the smallest to the end:**

| Pass | List State |
|------|------------|
| Initial | 34, -6, 12, -3, 45, 25 |
| After Pass 1 | 45, 34, 12, 25, -3, -6 |
| After Pass 2 | 45, 34, 25, 12, -3, -6 |
| After Pass 3 | 45, 34, 25, 12, -3, -6 |
| **After Pass 4** | **45, 34, 25, 12, -3, -6** |

**Selection Sort (descending) — each pass selects the maximum and places it in position:**

| Pass | Action | List State |
|------|--------|------------|
| Initial | — | 34, -6, 12, -3, 45, 25 |
| After Pass 1 | Place 45 at index 0 | 45, -6, 12, -3, 34, 25 |
| After Pass 2 | Place 34 at index 1 | 45, 34, 12, -3, -6, 25 |
| After Pass 3 | Place 25 at index 2 | 45, 34, 25, -3, -6, 12 |
| **After Pass 4** | Place 12 at index 3 | **45, 34, 25, 12, -6, -3** |

### Q3(b).
Write a method in Python to search for a value in a given list (assuming that the elements in the list are in ascending order) with the help of Binary Search method. The method should return -1 if the value is not present, else it should return the position of the value present in the list.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

```python
def BS(U, K):
    L = 0
    H = len(U) - 1
    flag = False
    while (L <= H) and (not flag):
        M = (L + H) // 2
        if U[M] == K:
            flag = True
        elif U[M] < K:
            L = M + 1
        else:
            H = M - 1
    if flag:
        return M + 1     # 1-based position
    else:
        return -1
```

**Solution:**
- `L` and `H` track the lower and upper bounds of the search range.
- `M` is the middle index.
- If `U[M] == K`, the element is found (`flag = True`).
- If `U[M] < K`, search the right half (`L = M + 1`).
- If `U[M] > K`, search the left half (`H = M - 1`).
- Returns position (1-based) if found, else -1.

### Q3(c).
Write `PUSH(Names)` and `POP(Names)` methods in Python to add Names and Remove names considering them to act as Push and Pop operations of Stack.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

```python
Stack = []

def PUSH(Names):
    Stack.append(Names)
    print('Element:', Names, 'Pushed')

def POP():
    if Stack == []:
        print('Stack is empty.....')
    else:
        print('Popped element is', Stack.pop())
```

### Q3(d).
Write a method in Python to find and display the composite numbers between 2 to N. Pass N as an argument to the method.

**(2 Marks)**

**Answer:**

```python
def com_num(N):
    for X in range(2, N+1):
        MID = X // 2
        for Y in range(2, MID+1):
            if X % Y == 0:
                print(X)
                break
```

**Solution:**
- A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.
- For each number X from 2 to N, check if any Y in range [2, X//2] divides X evenly.
- If yes, X is composite → print it and `break` the inner loop.

| Element Scanned | Stack Contents | Action |
|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| 34              | 34             | Push 34 |
| 23              | 34, 23         | Push 23 |
| +               | 57             | Pop 23 and 34; Push $34 + 23 = 57$ |
| 4               | 57, 4          | Push 4 |
| 5               | 57, 4, 5       | Push 5 |
| *               | 57, 20         | Pop 5 and 4; Push $4 \times 5 = 20$ |
| -               | 37             | Pop 20 and 57; Push $57 - 20 = 37$ |

$$\boxed{34 + 23 = 57; \quad 4 \times 5 = 20; \quad 57 - 20 = 37}$$

(i) `f = open('diary.txt', 'a')`
(ii) `f = open('diary.txt', 'w')`

**Answer:**

| Feature | `open('diary.txt', 'a')` | `open('diary.txt', 'w')` |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Mode | **Append mode** | **Write mode** |
| File pointer position | Positioned at the **end** of the file | Positioned at the **beginning** |
| Effect on existing data | Existing data is **preserved**; new data is added at the end | Existing data is **overwritten/erased** |
| File creation | Creates file if it doesn't exist | Creates file if it doesn't exist |

### Q4(c).
Consider the following definition of class `Student`. Write a method in Python to write the content in a pickled file `student.dat`.

**(2 Marks)**

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, A, N):
        self.Admno = A
        self.Name = N
    def Show(self):
        print(self.Admno, "#", self.Name)
```

**Answer:**

```python
import pickle

def write_data(self):
    PF = open('student.dat', 'wb')
    pickle.dump(self, PF)
    PF.close()
```

**Solution:**
- `pickle` module is imported to serialize Python objects.
- The file `student.dat` is opened in write-binary mode (`'wb'`).
- `pickle.dump(self, PF)` serializes the current `Student` object and writes it to the file.
- The file is then closed.

### Q5(a).
Observe the following table carefully and write the names of the most appropriate columns, which can be considered as (i) candidate keys and (ii) primary key:

**(2 Marks)**

| Code | Item                    | Qty | Price | Transaction Date |
|------|-------------------------|-----|-------|------------------|
| 1001 | Plastic Folder 14"      | 100 | 3400  | 2014-12-14       |
| 1004 | Pen Stand Standard      | 200 | 4500  | 2015-01-31       |
| 1005 | Stapler Mini            | 250 | 1200  | 2015-02-28       |
| 1009 | Punching Machine Small  | 200 | 1400  | 2015-03-12       |
| 1003 | Stapler Big             | 100 | 1500  | 2015-02-02       |

**Answer:**

**(i) Candidate Keys:** `Code` and `Item`

**(ii) Primary Key:** `Code`

**Solution:**
- A **candidate key** is any column (or set of columns) that can uniquely identify each row. Both `Code` and `Item` have unique values across all rows.
- The **primary key** is chosen from the candidate keys. `Code` is the most appropriate primary key as it is a numeric identifier and shorter than `Item`.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
WHERE Gender = 'FEMALE'
AND DOJ > '1986-01-01';
```

---

#### Q5(b)(v).
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), DCODE
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY DCODE
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Answer:**

| COUNT(\*) | DCODE |
|----------|-------|
| 2        | D01   |
| 2        | D05   |

**Solution:**
Groups employees by `DCODE` and shows only those groups with more than 1 employee. D01 has George K and Manila Sahai (2 employees); D05 has Mohitesh and Jaya Priya (2 employees).

---

#### Q5(b)(vi).
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT DEPARTMENT FROM DEPT;
```

**Answer:**

| DEPARTMENT     |
|----------------|
| INFRASTRUCTURE |
| MARKETING      |
| MEDIA          |
| FINANCE        |
| HUMAN RESOURCE |

**Solution:**
Since all department names in the `DEPT` table are already unique, `DISTINCT` returns all 5 department names.

---

#### Q5(b)(vii).
```sql
SELECT NAME, DEPARTMENT
FROM EMPLOYEE E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DCODE = D.DCODE
AND ENO < 1003;
```

**Answer:**

| NAME     | DEPARTMENT     |
|----------|----------------|
| George K | INFRASTRUCTURE |
| Ryma Sen | MEDIA          |

**Solution:**
Joins `EMPLOYEE` and `DEPT` on `DCODE`. Filters employees with `ENO < 1003`, which gives ENO 1001 (George K, D01 → INFRASTRUCTURE) and ENO 1002 (Ryma Sen, D03 → MEDIA).

---

#### Q5(b)(viii).
```sql
SELECT MAX(DOJ), MIN(DOB) FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Answer:**

| MAX(DOJ)   | MIN(DOB)   |
|------------|------------|
| 2014-06-09 | 1984-10-19 |

**Solution:**
- `MAX(DOJ)`: latest joining date = 2014-06-09 (Jaya Priya)
- `MIN(DOB)`: earliest date of birth = 1984-10-19 (Anil Jha, the oldest employee)

### Q6(a).
Verify the following using Boolean Laws:

**(2 Marks)**

$$U' + V = U'V' + U'V + UV$$

**Answer:**

**Taking L.H.S:**

$$U' + V$$

$$= U'(V + V') + V(U' + U)$$

*(Using Complement Law: $V + V' = 1$ and $U' + U = 1$)*

$$= U'V + U'V' + U'V + UV$$

*(Distributive expansion)*

$$= U'V + U'V' + UV$$

*(Since $U'V + U'V = U'V$ — Idempotent Law)*

$$= U'V' + U'V + UV$$

$$= \text{R.H.S}$$

$$\therefore \quad L.H.S = R.H.S \qquad \blacksquare$$

### Q6(b).
Draw the Logic Circuit for the following Boolean Expression:

**(2 Marks)**

$$(X' + Y) \cdot Z + W'$$

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Logic circuit described as follows:
- Input X passes through a NOT gate to produce X'
- X' and Y are fed into an OR gate to produce (X' + Y)
- The output of the OR gate and Z are fed into an AND gate to produce (X' + Y)·Z
- Input W passes through a NOT gate to produce W'
- (X' + Y)·Z and W' are fed into a final OR gate to produce the output (X' + Y)·Z + W']

The circuit uses: 2 NOT gates (for X and W), 1 OR gate (for X'+Y), 1 AND gate, and 1 final OR gate.

### Q6(c).
Derive a Canonical POS expression for a Boolean function F, represented by the following truth table:

**(2 Marks)**

| P | Q | R | F(P,Q,R) |
|---|---|---|----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1        |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0        |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0        |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1        |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1        |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0        |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0        |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1        |

**Answer:**

$$F(P, Q, R) = (P + Q + R')(P + Q' + R)(P' + Q + R')(P' + Q' + R)$$

**Solution:**
For POS (Product of Sums), we identify the **minterms where F = 0** (rows 1, 2, 5, 6 using 0-based indexing):
- Row 1: P=0, Q=0, R=1 → Maxterm: $(P + Q + R')$ (complement each variable that is 1)
- Row 2: P=0, Q=1, R=0 → Maxterm: $(P + Q' + R)$
- Row 5: P=1, Q=0, R=1 → Maxterm: $(P' + Q + R')$
- Row 6: P=1, Q=1, R=0 → Maxterm: $(P' + Q' + R)$

$$F(P, Q, R) = (P + Q + R')(P + Q' + R)(P' + Q + R')(P' + Q' + R)$$

### Q6(d).
Reduce the following Boolean Expression to its simplest form using K-Map:

**(2 Marks)**

$$F(X, Y, Z, W) = \sum(0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15)$$

**Answer:**

**Simplified Expression:**

$$F = Y'Z' + X'Y + XZW$$

**Solution:**

K-Map (4-variable, variables: X, Y, Z, W):

[Diagram: 4×4 K-Map with rows labeled ZW = Z'W', Z'W, ZW, ZW' and columns labeled XY = X'Y', X'Y, XY, XY'. Cells with value 1 are at positions corresponding to minterms 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15.]

```
         X'Y'   X'Y    XY     XY'
Z'W'  |  1   |  1   |      |  1   |
Z'W   |  1   |  1   |      |  1   |
ZW    |      |  1   |  1   |  1   |
ZW'   |      |  1   |      |      |
```

**Groups identified:**
1. **Group 1** (minterms 0, 1, 4, 5 + 8, 9 → 8-cell group with X'Y' and XY' for Z'W' and Z'W): covers $Y'Z'$
2. **Group 2** (minterms 4, 5, 6, 7 → 4-cell group X'Y): covers $X'Y$
3. **Group 3** (minterms 11, 15 → 2-cell group XZW): covers $XZW$

$$\boxed{F = Y'Z' + X'Y + XZW}$$
