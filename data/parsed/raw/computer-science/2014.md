## Question 1

### Q1(a). [2 Marks]

What is the difference between call by reference and call by value with respect to memory allocation? Give a suitable example to illustrate using C++ code.

**Answer:**

| Call by Value | Call by Reference |
|---|---|
| A variable's value is transferred to another variable. | A variable copy (alias) is made — no new memory is allocated for the parameter. |

**Call by Value — Example:**

```cpp
void Implement(int a1, int b1)
{
    a1++;
    b1++;
    cout << a1 << " " << b1 << endl;
}

void main()
{
    int a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;   // Output: 2 3
    Implement(a, b);                  // Output: 3 4
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;   // Output: 2 3  (originals unchanged)
}
```

**Output:**
```
2 3
3 4
2 3
```

**Call by Reference — Example:**

```cpp
void Implement(int &a1, int &b1)
{
    a1++;
    b1++;
    cout << a1 << " " << b1 << endl;
}

void main()
{
    int a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;   // Output: 2 3
    Implement(a, b);                  // Output: 3 4
    cout << a << " " << b << endl;   // Output: 3 4  (originals changed)
}
```

**Output:**
```
2 3
3 4
3 4
```

### Q1(b). [1 Mark]

Observe the following C++ code and write the name(s) of the header file(s) which will be essentially required to run it in a C++ compiler:

```cpp
void main()
{
    char CH, STR[20];
    cin >> STR;
    CH = toupper(STR[0]);
    cout << STR << " starts with" << CH << endl;
}
```

**Answer:** `<iostream.h>` and `<ctype.h>`

**Solution:**
- `<iostream.h>` is required for `cin` and `cout`.
- `<ctype.h>` is required for the `toupper()` function.

---

### Q1(c). [2 Marks]

Rewrite the following C++ code after removing all the syntax error(s), if present in the code. Underline each correction made.

**Original (erroneous) code:**

```cpp
typedef char[80] STR;
void main()
{
    Txt STR;
    Gets(Txt);
    cout << Txt[0] << '\t << Txt[2];
    cout << Txt << endline;
}
```

**Answer (corrected code — corrections underlined in description):**

```cpp
typedef char STR[80];          // Correction 1: char STR[80] instead of char[80] STR
void main()
{
    STR Txt;                   // Correction 2: STR Txt instead of Txt STR
    gets(Txt);                 // Correction 3: gets (lowercase) instead of Gets
    cout << Txt[0] << "\t" << Txt[2];   // Correction 4: "\t" (string) instead of '\t
    cout << Txt << endl;       // Correction 5: endl instead of endline
}
```

**Solution — List of corrections:**

| # | Error | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `typedef char[80] STR` | `typedef char STR[80]` |
| 2 | `Txt STR` | `STR Txt` |
| 3 | `Gets(Txt)` | `gets(Txt)` |
| 4 | `'\t` (unclosed/wrong quote) | `"\t"` |
| 5 | `endline` | `endl` |

---

### Q1(d). [2 Marks]

Obtain the output from the following C++ program as expected to appear on the screen after its execution.

> *All desired header files are already included.*

```cpp
void main()
{
    char *Text = "AJANTA";
    int *P,
    Num[] = {1, 5, 7, 9};
    P = Num;
    cout << *P << Text << endl;
    Text++;
    P++;
    cout << *P << Text << endl;
}
```

**Answer:**

```
1AJANTA
5JANTA
```

**Solution:**

- Initially, `P` points to `Num[0]` = 1, and `Text` points to `'A'` (start of `"AJANTA"`).
- First `cout`: `*P` = 1, `Text` = `"AJANTA"` → prints `1AJANTA`
- `Text++`: pointer advances by 1 character → now points to `"JANTA"`
- `P++`: pointer advances to `Num[1]` → `*P` = 5
- Second `cout`: `*P` = 5, `Text` = `"JANTA"` → prints `5JANTA`

---

### Q1(e). [3 Marks]

Obtain the output of the following C++ program which will appear on the screen after its execution.

> *All desired header files are already included.*

```cpp
class Game
{
    int Level, Score;
    char Type;
public:
    Game(char GType = 'P')
    { Level = 1; Score = 0; Type = GType; }
    void Play(int GS);
    void Change();
    void Show()
    {
        cout << Type << "@" << Level << endl;
        cout << Score << endl;
    }
};

void main()
{
    Game A('G'), B;
    B.Show();
    A.Play(11);
    A.Change();
    B.Play(25);
    A.Show();
    B.Show();
}

void Game::Change()
{
    Type = (Type == 'P') ? 'G' : 'P';
}

void Game::Play(int GS)
{
    Score += GS;
    if (Score >= 30)
        Level = 3;
    else if (Score >= 20)
        Level = 2;
    else
        Level = 1;
}
```

**Answer:**

```
P@1
0
P@1
11
P@2
25
```

**Solution — Step-by-step trace:**

| Statement | Object A (Type, Level, Score) | Object B (Type, Level, Score) |
|---|---|---|
| `Game A('G'), B` | G, 1, 0 | P, 1, 0 |
| `B.Show()` | — | Prints: `P@1` then `0` |
| `A.Play(11)` | Score = 0+11 = 11; 11 < 20 → Level = 1; A = G,1,11 | — |
| `A.Change()` | Type = (G≠P) → 'P'; A = P,1,11 | — |
| `B.Play(25)` | — | Score = 0+25 = 25; 25 ≥ 20 → Level = 2; B = P,2,25 |
| `A.Show()` | Prints: `P@1` then `11` | — |
| `B.Show()` | — | Prints: `P@2` then `25` |

### Q1(f). [2 Marks]

Read the following C++ code carefully and find out which out of the given options (i) to (iv) are the expected correct output(s). Also write the maximum and minimum value that can be assigned to the variable `Taker`.

```cpp
void main()
{
    int GuessMe[4] = {100, 50, 200, 20};
    int Taker = random(2) + 2;
    for (int Chance = 0; Chance < Taker; Chance++)
        cout << GuessMe[Chance] << "#";
}
```

Options:
- (i) `100#`
- (ii) `50#100#`
- (iii) `100#50#200#`
- (iv) `100#50#`

**Answer:** Options **(iii) `100#50#200#`** and **(iv) `100#50#`** are the correct possible outputs.

**Solution:**

- `random(2)` returns a value in the range `[0, 1]` (i.e., 0 or 1).
- Therefore `Taker = random(2) + 2` gives either **2** or **3**.
- If `Taker = 2`: loop runs for `Chance = 0, 1` → prints `100#50#` → option **(iv)**
- If `Taker = 3`: loop runs for `Chance = 0, 1, 2` → prints `100#50#200#` → option **(iii)**

| Value | Taker | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum | 2 | `100#50#` |
| Maximum | 3 | `100#50#200#` |

> **Minimum value of Taker:** 2
> **Maximum value of Taker:** 3

## Question 2

### Q2(a). [2 Marks]

What is function overloading? Write an example using C++ to illustrate the concept of function overloading.

**Answer:**

**Definition:** Function overloading refers to defining two or more functions with the **same name** but differing in the **number of parameters** or the **data types** of the parameters. The compiler selects the appropriate function based on the arguments passed at the call site.

**Example:**

```cpp
void sum(int a, int b)
{
    cout << "Sum = " << a + b;
}

void sum(int a, int b, int c)
{
    cout << "Sum = " << a + b + c;
}

void main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
    sum(a, b);       // Calls first version → Sum = 3
    sum(a, b, c);    // Calls second version → Sum = 6
}
```

---

### Q2(b). [2 Marks]

Answer the questions (i) and (ii) after going through the following class:

```cpp
class Hospital
{
    int Pno, Dno;
public:
    Hospital(int PN);        // Function 1
    Hospital();              // Function 2
    Hospital(Hospital &H);   // Function 3
    void In();               // Function 4
    void Disp();             // Function 5
};

void main()
{
    Hospital H(20);   // Statement 1
}
```

#### Q2(b)(i).

Which of the functions out of Function 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 will get executed when Statement 1 is executed?

**Answer:** **Function 1** — `Hospital(int PN)` will be called, because Statement 1 passes a single integer argument `20` to the constructor.

---

#### Q2(b)(ii).

Write a statement to declare a new object `G` with reference to the already existing object `H` using Function 3.

**Answer:**

```cpp
Hospital G(H);
```

**Solution:** Function 3 is the **copy constructor** `Hospital(Hospital &H)`. Declaring `Hospital G(H)` creates a new object `G` by copying the existing object `H`, which invokes Function 3.

---

### Q2(c). [4 Marks]

Define a class `Tourist` in C++ with the following specification:

**Data Members:**
- `CNo` — to store Cab No
- `CType` — to store a character `'A'`, `'B'`, or `'C'` as City Type
- `PerKM` — to store per Kilometre charges
- `Distance` — to store Distance travelled (in KM)

**Member Functions:**
- A constructor to initialize `CType` as `'A'` and `CNo` as `0000`
- `CityCharges()` — to assign `PerKM` as per the table below:

| CType | PerKM |
|---|---|
| A | 20 |
| B | 18 |
| C | 15 |

- `RegisterCab()` — to allow administrator to enter values for `CNo` and `CType`; also calls `CityCharges()` to assign `PerKM`
- `Display()` — to allow user to enter value of `Distance` and display `CNo`, `CType`, `PerKM`, and `PerKM * Distance` (as Amount) on screen

**Answer:**

```cpp
class Tourist
{
    int CNo;
    char CType;
    int PerKM;
    int Distance;

public:
    Tourist()
    {
        CType = 'A';
        CNo = 0;
    }

    void CityCharges()
    {
        if (CType == 'A')
            PerKM = 20;
        else if (CType == 'B')
            PerKM = 18;
        else if (CType == 'C')
            PerKM = 15;
    }

    void RegisterCab()
    {
        cout << "Enter the Cab No: ";
        cin >> CNo;
        cout << "Enter Cab Type: ";
        cin >> CType;
        CityCharges();
    }

    void Display()
    {
        cout << "Enter the Distance: ";
        cin >> Distance;
        cout << "Cab No is: "    << CNo             << endl;
        cout << "Cab Type is: "  << CType            << endl;
        cout << "Per KM charge: "<< PerKM            << endl;
        cout << "Amount is: "    << PerKM * Distance << endl;
    }
};
```

### Q2(d). [4 Marks]

Consider the following C++ code and answer questions (i) to (iv):

```cpp
class University
{
    long Id;
    char City[20];
protected:
    char Country[20];
public:
    University();
    void Register();
    void Display();
};

class Department : private University
{
    long DCode[10];
    char HOD[20];
protected:
    double Budget;
public:
    Department();
    void Enter();
    void Show();
};

class Student : public Department
{
    long RollNo;
    char Name[20];
public:
    Student();
    void Enroll();
    void view();
};
```

#### Q2(d)(i).

Which type of Inheritance is shown in the above example?

**Answer:** **Multilevel Inheritance** is demonstrated — `University` is the base class, `Department` inherits from `University`, and `Student` inherits from `Department`.

---

#### Q2(d)(ii).

Write the names of those member functions which are directly accessible from objects of class `Student`.

**Answer:**

```
void Enroll();
void view();
void Enter();
void Show();
```

**Solution:** Since `Student` inherits `Department` publicly, all `public` members of `Department` (`Enter()`, `Show()`) become public in `Student` and are directly accessible. `Student`'s own public members (`Enroll()`, `view()`) are also directly accessible. The `public` members of `University` (`Register()`, `Display()`) become **private** in `Department` (due to private inheritance) and are therefore **not** accessible from `Student` objects.

---

#### Q2(d)(iii).

Write the names of those data members which can be directly accessible from the member functions of class `Student`.

**Answer:**

```
long RollNo;
char Name[20];
double Budget;
```

**Solution:**
- `RollNo` and `Name` are `Student`'s own private members — accessible within its own member functions.
- `Budget` is `protected` in `Department`; since `Student` inherits `Department` publicly, `Budget` is accessible within `Student`'s member functions.
- `Country` (protected in `University`) becomes **private** in `Department` due to private inheritance and is **not** accessible in `Student`.
- `Id`, `City` (private in `University`) are never accessible in derived classes.

---

#### Q2(d)(iv).

Is it possible to directly call function `Display()` of class `University` from an object of class `Department`?

**Answer:** **No.**

**Solution:** `Department` inherits `University` using **private** inheritance. As a result, all `public` members of `University` (including `Display()`) become **private** members of `Department`. Private members cannot be accessed through objects from outside the class, so `Display()` cannot be called directly from a `Department` object.

## Question 3

### Q3(a). [3 Marks]

Write a code for a function `EvenOdd(int T[], int C)` in C++ to add 1 to all odd values and add 2 to all even values of the array `T`.

**Example:**

| T[0] | T[1] | T[2] | T[3] | T[4] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35 | 12 | 16 | 69 | 26 |

**Modified content:**

| T[0] | T[1] | T[2] | T[3] | T[4] |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 36 | 14 | 18 | 70 | 28 |

**Answer:**

```cpp
void EvenOdd(int T[], int C)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i <= C - 1; i++)
    {
        if (T[i] % 2 == 0)
            T[i] = T[i] + 2;
        else
            T[i] = T[i] + 1;
    }

    cout << "Modified content: ";
    for (i = 0; i <= C - 1; i++)
        cout << T[i] << " ";
}
```

---

### Q3(b). [3 Marks]

An array `A[20][30]` is stored **row-wise** in memory with each element requiring **4 bytes** of storage. If the base address of array `A` is **32000**, find:
1. The location of `A[15][10]`
2. The total number of elements present in this array

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Base address $B = 32000$
- Size of each element $W = 4$ bytes
- Number of columns $N = 30$
- Row index $I = 15$, Column index $J = 10$
- Lower bounds: $I_0 = 0$, $J_0 = 0$ (0-based indexing)

**Formula (Row-Major):**

$$\text{Address}(A[I][J]) = B + W \times \bigl[N \times (I - I_0) + (J - J_0)\bigr]$$

**Calculation:**

$$\text{Address}(A[15][10]) = 32000 + 4 \times [30 \times (15 - 0) + (10 - 0)]$$

$$= 32000 + 4 \times [450 + 10]$$

$$= 32000 + 4 \times 460$$

$$= 32000 + 1840$$

$$= \mathbf{33840}$$

**Location of A[15][10] = 33840**

**Total number of elements** $= 20 \times 30 = \mathbf{600}$

---

### Q3(c). [2 Marks]

Write a user-defined function `AddEnd2(int A[][4], int N, int M)` in C++ to find and display the sum of all values which end with 2 (i.e., units digit is 2).

**Example:**

| 22 | 16 | 12 |
|---|---|---|
| 19 | 5 | 2 |

**Output should be:** `36` (i.e., 22 + 12 + 2 = 36)

**Answer:**

```cpp
void AddEnd2(int A[][4], int N, int M)
{
    int i, j, Sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i <= N - 1; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; j <= M - 1; j++)
        {
            if (A[i][j] % 10 == 2)
                Sum = Sum + A[i][j];
        }
    }
    cout << Sum;
}
```

### Q3(d). [2 Marks]

Evaluate the following postfix expression. Show the status of the stack after execution of each operation separately:

```
T, F, NOT, AND, T, OR, F, AND
```

**Answer:**

| Symbol | Operation | Stack (bottom → top) |
|---|---|---|
| T | PUSH T | T |
| F | PUSH F | T, F |
| NOT | POP one element (F); apply NOT → T; PUSH T | T, T |
| AND | POP two elements (T, T); apply AND → T; PUSH T | T |
| T | PUSH T | T, T |
| OR | POP two elements (T, T); apply OR → T; PUSH T | T |
| F | PUSH F | T, F |
| AND | POP two elements (T, F); apply AND → F; PUSH F | F |

**Final Result: F**

---

### Q3(e). [4 Marks]

Write a function `PUSHBOOK()` in C++ to perform the **insert (push) operation** on a Dynamic Stack which contains `Book_No` and `Book_Title`. Use the following definition of `NODE`:

```cpp
struct NODE
{
    int Book_No;
    char Book_Title[20];
    NODE *Next;
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
NODE *top = NULL;   // Global top pointer

void PUSHBOOK()
{
    NODE *P = new NODE;
    cout << "Enter Book No. and Book Title: ";
    cin >> P->Book_No;
    gets(P->Book_Title);

    if (top == NULL)
    {
        P->Next = NULL;
        top = P;
    }
    else
    {
        P->Next = top;
        top = P;
    }
}
```

**Solution:**
- A new node `P` is created dynamically.
- The user enters `Book_No` and `Book_Title` into the new node.
- If the stack is empty (`top == NULL`), the new node's `Next` is set to `NULL` and `top` is updated to point to this node.
- If the stack is non-empty, the new node's `Next` is set to the current `top`, and then `top` is updated to the new node (standard stack push).

## Question 4

### Q4(a). [1 Mark]

Fill in the blanks marked as **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** in the program segment given below with appropriate functions for the required task.

```cpp
class Agency
{
    int ANo;           // Agent Code
    char AName[20];    // Agent Name
    char Mobile[12];   // Agent Mobile
public:
    void Enter();
    void Disp();
    int RAno() { return ANo; }
    void UpdateMobile()
    {
        cout << "Updated Mobile: ";
        gets(Mobile);
    }
};

void AgentUpdate()
{
    fstream F;
    F.open("AGENT.DAT", ios::binary | ios::in | ios::out);
    int Updt = 0;
    int UAno;
    cout << "Ano (Agent No. to update Mobile): ";
    cin >> UAno;
    Agency A;
    while (!Updt && F.read((char*)&A, sizeof(A)))
    {
        if (A.RAno() == UAno)
        {
            // Statement 1: To call the function to Update Mobile No.
            _______________________________;

            // Statement 2: To reposition file pointer to re-write the
            // updated object back in the file
            _______________________________;

            F.write((char*)&A, sizeof(A));
            Updt++;
        }
    }
    if (Updt)
        cout << "Mobile Updated for Agent" << UAno << endl;
    else
        cout << "Agent not in the Agency" << endl;
    F.close();
}
```

**Answer:**

- **Statement 1:** `A.UpdateMobile();`
- **Statement 2:** `F.seekp(-1 * sizeof(A), ios::cur);`

**Solution:**
- Statement 1 calls the member function `UpdateMobile()` on object `A` to get the new mobile number from the user.
- Statement 2 moves the file put-pointer **backward** by one record size (using `seekp` with `ios::cur`) so that the updated object `A` is written back over the same position that was just read.

```
CBSE enhanced its CCE guidelines further.
```
The function should display:
```
A: 1
E: 7
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void AECount()
{
    char Ch;
    ifstream fcin("NOTES.TXT");
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

    while (!fcin.eof())
    {
        fcin.get(Ch);
        if (Ch == 'A' || Ch == 'a')
            count1++;
        else if (Ch == 'E' || Ch == 'e')
            count2++;
    }

    fcin.close();
    cout << "A: " << count1 << endl;
    cout << "E: " << count2 << endl;
}
```

### Q4(c). [3 Marks]

Assuming the class `TOYS` as declared below, write a function in C++ to read the objects of `TOYS` from binary file `TOYS.DAT` and display the details of those TOYS which are meant for children of AgeRange **"5 to 8"**.

```cpp
class TOYS
{
    int ToyCode;
    char ToyName[10];
    char AgeRange[10];
public:
    void Enter()
    {
        cin >> ToyCode;
        gets(ToyName);
        gets(AgeRange);
    }
    void Display()
    {
        cout << ToyCode << ": " << ToyName << endl;
        cout << AgeRange << endl;
    }
    char* WhatAge() { return AgeRange; }
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void Show()
{
    TOYS T;
    ifstream fcin("TOYS.DAT", ios::in | ios::binary);

    while (fcin.read((char*)&T, sizeof(T)))
    {
        if (strcmp(T.WhatAge(), "5 to 8") == 0)
            T.Display();
    }

    fcin.close();
}
```

**Solution:**
- Open `TOYS.DAT` in binary read mode.
- Read each `TOYS` object one at a time using `read()`.
- Use `strcmp()` to compare `AgeRange` with `"5 to 8"`.
- If they match, call `Display()` to print the toy's details.
- Close the file after reading all records.

## Question 5

### Q5(a). [2 Marks]

Explain the concept of **Cartesian Product** between two tables, with the help of an appropriate example.

**Answer:**

The **Cartesian Product** (also called a Cross Join) of two tables combines **every row** of the first table with **every row** of the second table. If Table 1 has $m$ rows and Table 2 has $n$ rows, the result has $m \times n$ rows.

**Table 1:**

| Roll\_No | Name | Marks |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | ABC | 90 |
| 13 | MNO | 95 |
| 14 | XYZ | 85 |

**Table 2:**

| SRoll\_No | Name | Age |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | ABC | 14 |
| 13 | MNO | 12 |
| 16 | EPG | 15 |

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Table1, Table2;
```

**Result (Cartesian Product — 3 × 3 = 9 rows):**

| Roll\_No | Name | Marks | SRoll\_No | Name | Age |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | ABC | 90 | 12 | ABC | 14 |
| 13 | MNO | 95 | 12 | ABC | 14 |
| 14 | XYZ | 85 | 12 | ABC | 14 |
| 12 | ABC | 90 | 13 | MNO | 12 |
| 13 | MNO | 95 | 13 | MNO | 12 |
| 14 | XYZ | 85 | 13 | MNO | 12 |
| 12 | ABC | 90 | 16 | EPG | 15 |
| 13 | MNO | 95 | 16 | EPG | 15 |
| 14 | XYZ | 85 | 16 | EPG | 15 |

## Question 6

### Q6(a). [2 Marks]

Name the law shown below and verify it using a truth table:

$$X + X' \cdot Y = X + Y$$

**Answer:**

This is the **Absorption Law** (or **Simplification Theorem**).

**Verification — Truth Table:**

| X | Y | X' | X'·Y | X + X'·Y | X + Y |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

Since columns **X + X'·Y** and **X + Y** are identical for all input combinations, the law is verified. ✓

### Q6(b). [2 Marks]

Obtain the Boolean Expression for the logic circuit shown below.

[Diagram: Inputs A and B go into a NAND gate. Inputs C and D go into a NOR gate (D is inverted/NOT before the NOR). The outputs of the NAND gate and the NOR gate feed into an OR gate to produce output F.]

**Answer:**

**Step-by-step derivation:**

- NAND gate with inputs A and B: output $= \overline{A \cdot B}$
- D is first inverted: $\overline{D}$
- NOR gate with inputs C and $\overline{D}$: output $= \overline{C + \overline{D}}$; by De Morgan's this simplifies to $\overline{C} \cdot D$
- OR gate combines both outputs:

$$F(A, B, C, D) = \overline{A \cdot B} + \overline{C} \cdot D$$

---

### Q6(c). [1 Mark]

Write the **Product of Sum (POS)** form of the function $F(X, Y, Z)$ for the following truth table:

| X | Y | Z | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Answer:**

POS form takes the **maxterms** (rows where F = 0), i.e., minterms 1, 2, 4, 5:

$$F(X, Y, Z) = (X + Y + \overline{Z}) \cdot (X + \overline{Y} + Z) \cdot (\overline{X} + Y + Z) \cdot (\overline{X} + Y + \overline{Z})$$
