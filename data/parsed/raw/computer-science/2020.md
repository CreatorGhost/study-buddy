**Set Code:** 91/C (Set-4)
**Total Marks:** 70
**Duration:** 3 Hours

---

## Section A — 1–4 Marks (as specified per question)

---

### Q1(a).
Which of the following is **not** a valid variable name in Python? Justify the reason for it not being a valid name.

(i) 5Radius
(ii) Radius_
(iii) _Radius
(iv) Radius

**Answer:** (i) 5Radius

**Solution:** `5Radius` is not a valid variable name in Python because variable names cannot begin with a digit. In Python, identifiers must start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or an underscore (_). All other options — `Radius_`, `_Radius`, and `Radius` — are valid identifiers.

---

### Q1(b).
Which of the following are **keywords** in Python?

(i) break
(ii) check
(iii) range
(iv) while

**Answer:** (i) `break`, (iii) `range`, (iv) `while`

**Solution:**
- `break` — a reserved keyword used to exit loops.
- `range` — a built-in keyword/function used in loops.
- `while` — a reserved keyword used for looping.
- `check` — is **not** a Python keyword; it has no special meaning in Python.

---

### Q1(c).
Name the Python Library modules which need to be imported to invoke the following functions:

(i) `cos()`
(ii) `randint()`

**Answer:**
- (i) `math`
- (ii) `random`

**Solution:**
- `cos()` is defined in the `math` module, which provides mathematical functions.
- `randint()` is defined in the `random` module, which provides random number generation functions.

---

### Q1(d).
Rewrite the following code in Python after removing all syntax error(s). Underline each correction done in the code. *(2 marks)*

```python
input('Enter a word', W)
if W = 'Hello':
print('Ok')
else:
print('Not Ok')
```

**Answer:**

```python
W = input('Enter a word')        # Correction 1: Assignment W = input(...)
if W == 'Hello' :                # Correction 2: == instead of =; Correction 3: colon after condition
    print('Ok')
else :                           # Correction 4: proper else with colon
    print('Not Ok')
```

**Solution:**
- **Error 1:** `input('Enter a word', W)` — `input()` does not take a variable as a second argument. Corrected to `W = input('Enter a word')`.
- **Error 2:** `if W = 'Hello'` — single `=` is assignment, not comparison. Corrected to `==`.
- **Error 3:** Missing `:` after the `if` condition (corrected alongside Error 2).
- **Error 4:** `else` block had no colon. Corrected to `else :`.

### Q1(e).
Find and write the output of the following Python code: *(2 marks)*

```python
def ChangeVal(M, N):
    for i in range(N):
        if M[i] % 5 == 0:
            M[i] //= 5
        if M[i] % 3 == 0:
            M[i] //= 3

L = [25, 8, 75, 12]
ChangeVal(L, 4)
for i in L:
    print(i, end='#')
```

**Answer:**
```
5#8#5#4#
```

**Solution:** Trace through `ChangeVal(L, 4)` with `L = [25, 8, 75, 12]`:

| Index | Initial | Divisible by 5? | After ÷5 | Divisible by 3? | After ÷3 | Final |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | 25 | Yes (25%5==0) | 5 | No (5%3≠0) | — | **5** |
| 1 | 8 | No | — | No | — | **8** |
| 2 | 75 | Yes (75%5==0) | 15 | Yes (15%3==0) | 5 | **5** |
| 3 | 12 | No | — | Yes (12%3==0) | 4 | **4** |

Output: `5#8#5#4#`

---

### Q1(f).
Find and write the output of the following Python code: *(3 marks)*

```python
def Call(P=40, Q=20):
    P = P + Q
    Q = P - Q
    print(P, '@', Q)
    return P

R = 200
S = 100
R = Call(R, S)
print(R, '@', S)
S = Call(S)
print(R, '@', S)
```

**Answer:**
```
300 @ 200
300 @ 100
120 @ 100
300 @ 120
```

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** `R = Call(R, S)` → `Call(200, 100)`
- $P = 200 + 100 = 300$
- $Q = 300 - 100 = 200$
- `print(300, '@', 200)` → **300 @ 200**
- Returns 300, so `R = 300`

**Step 2:** `print(R, '@', S)` → `R = 300`, `S = 100` (unchanged globally)
- Output: **300 @ 100**

**Step 3:** `S = Call(S)` → `Call(100)` (uses default Q=20)
- $P = 100 + 20 = 120$
- $Q = 120 - 20 = 100$
- `print(120, '@', 100)` → **120 @ 100**
- Returns 120, so `S = 120`

**Step 4:** `print(R, '@', S)` → `R = 300`, `S = 120`
- Output: **300 @ 120**

---

### Q1(g).
What possible output(s) are expected to be displayed on screen at the time of execution of the program from the following code? Also specify the **minimum** and **maximum** values that can be assigned to the variable `End`. *(2 marks)*

```python
import random
Colours = ["VIOLET", "INDIGO", "BLUE", "GREEN", "YELLOW", "ORANGE", "RED"]
End = randrange(2) + 3
Begin = randrange(End) + 1
for i in range(Begin, End):
    print(Colours[i], end='&')
```

Options:
- (i) `INDIGO&BLUE&GREEN&`
- (ii) `VIOLET&INDIGO&BLUE&`
- (iii) `BLUE&GREEN&YELLOW&`
- (iv) `GREEN&YELLOW&ORANGE&`

**Answer:** **(i) INDIGO&BLUE&GREEN&**

**Minimum Value of End = 3**
**Maximum Value of End = 4**

**Solution:**
- `randrange(2)` returns either `0` or `1`, so `End = 0+3 = 3` or `End = 1+3 = 4`.
- `Begin = randrange(End) + 1`:
  - If `End = 3`: `randrange(3)` → 0, 1, or 2 → `Begin` = 1, 2, or 3
  - If `End = 4`: `randrange(4)` → 0, 1, 2, or 3 → `Begin` = 1, 2, 3, or 4
- `range(Begin, End)` must produce at least one value (Begin < End).
- Checking option (i): `Begin=1`, `End=4` → `range(1,4)` → indices 1,2,3 → `INDIGO&BLUE&GREEN&` ✓
- Option (ii): Would need `Begin=0`, but `Begin = randrange(End)+1 ≥ 1`, so index 0 (VIOLET) is never reached. ✗
- Option (iii): Would need `Begin=2, End=5` — `End` max is 4. ✗
- Option (iv): Would need `Begin=3, End=6` — out of range. ✗

## Section A — Q2 (1–2 marks as specified)

---

### Q2(a).
Write the names of the **immutable** data objects from the following: *(1 mark)*

(i) List
(ii) Tuple
(iii) String
(iv) Dictionary

**Answer:** (ii) Tuple, (iii) String

**Solution:** In Python, immutable objects cannot be changed after creation. `Tuple` and `String` are immutable. `List` and `Dictionary` are mutable — their contents can be modified after creation.

---

### Q2(b).
Write a Python statement to declare a Dictionary named `ClassRoll` with Keys as `1`, `2`, `3` and corresponding values as `'Reena'`, `'Rakesh'`, `'Zareen'` respectively. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:**
```python
ClassRoll = {1: "Reena", 2: "Rakesh", 3: "Zareen"}
```

**Solution:** A Python dictionary is declared using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. Multiple pairs are separated by commas.

---

### Q2(c).
Which of the options out of (i) to (iv) is the correct data type for the variable `Vowels` as defined in the following Python statement? *(1 mark)*

```python
Vowels = ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
```

(i) List
(ii) Dictionary
(iii) Tuple
(iv) Array

**Answer:** (iii) Tuple

**Solution:** In Python, parentheses `()` with comma-separated values define a **Tuple**. Lists use `[]`, Dictionaries use `{}`, and Arrays require importing the `array` module.

---

### Q2(d).
Write the output of the following Python code: *(1 mark)*

```python
for i in range(2, 7, 2):
    print(i * '$')
```

**Answer:**
```
$$
$$$$
$$$$$$
```

**Solution:** `range(2, 7, 2)` generates values: 2, 4, 6.
- `i = 2`: prints `$$`
- `i = 4`: prints `$$$$`
- `i = 6`: prints `$$$$$$`

---

### Q2(e).
Write the output of the following Python code: *(1 mark)*

```python
def Update(X=10):
    X += 15
    print('X = ', X)

X = 20
Update()
print('X = ', X)
```

**Answer:**
```
X =  25
X =  20
```

**Solution:**
- `X = 20` is a global variable.
- `Update()` is called without arguments, so the default parameter `X=10` is used inside the function.
- Inside `Update`: $X = 10 + 15 = 25$ → prints `X = 25`.
- The global `X` is unaffected (Python functions have local scope for parameters), so `print('X = ', X)` prints `X = 20`.

---

### Q2(f).
Differentiate between `"w"` and `"r"` file modes used in Python. Illustrate the difference using suitable examples. *(2 marks)*

**Answer:**

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `"w"` | Opens a file for **writing**. Creates the file if it doesn't exist; overwrites if it does. |
| `"r"` | Opens a file for **reading**. File must already exist; raises an error if not found. |

**Solution:**

```python
def Create():
    file = open('NOTES.TXT', 'w')   # Opens for writing
    S = "This is a sample"
    file.write(S)
    file.close()

def Read():
    file = open('NOTES.TXT', 'r')   # Opens for reading
    Lines = file.readline()
    print(Lines)
    file.close()

Create()
Read()
```

- `"w"` mode: Used to write content into a file. If the file already exists, it is **truncated** (old data is lost).
- `"r"` mode: Used to read content from a file. The file **must exist** beforehand, otherwise a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

### Q2(g).
A pie chart is to be drawn (using pyplot) to represent Pollution Level of Cities. Write appropriate statements in Python to provide labels for the pie slices as the names of the Cities and the size of each pie slice representing the corresponding Pollution of the Cities as per the following table: *(2 marks)*

| Cities | Pollution |
|--------|-----------|
| Mumbai | 350 |
| Delhi | 475 |
| Chennai | 315 |
| Bangalore | 390 |

**Answer:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Cities = ['Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Chennai', 'Bangalore']
Pollution = [350, 475, 315, 390]

plt.pie(Pollution, labels=Cities)
plt.show()
```

**Solution:** `plt.pie()` creates a pie chart. The first argument is the list of sizes (values) for each slice, and `labels=Cities` assigns the city names as labels to the corresponding pie slices. `plt.show()` renders and displays the chart.

**OR**

Write the output from the given Python code: *(2 marks)*

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Months = ['Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar']
Marks = [70, 90, 75, 95]
plt.bar(Months, Marks)
plt.show()
```

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A vertical bar chart with the x-axis showing months: Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, and the y-axis showing Marks values. Four bars are displayed with approximate heights — Dec: 70, Jan: 90, Feb: 75, Mar: 95. The tallest bar is at Mar (95) and the shortest at Dec (70).]

---

### Q2(h).
Write a function `Show_words()` in Python to read the content of a text file `NOTES.TXT` and display the entire content in **capital letters**. *(2 marks)*

Example — if the file contains:
```
This is a test file
```
The function should display:
```
THIS IS A TEST FILE
```

**Answer:**

```python
def Show_words():
    file = open('NOTES.TXT', 'r')
    Lines = file.readlines()
    for L in Lines:
        print(L.upper())
    file.close()
```

**Solution:** The file is opened in read mode. `readlines()` returns a list of all lines. Each line `L` is converted to uppercase using `.upper()` and printed.

**OR**

Write a function `Show_words()` in Python to read the content of a text file `NOTES.TXT` and display only such lines of the file which have **exactly 5 words** in them. *(2 marks)*

Example — if the file contains:
```
This is a sample file.
The file contains many sentences.
But needs only sentences which have only 5 words.
```
The function should display:
```
This is a sample file.
The file contains many sentences.
```

**Answer:**

```python
def Show_words():
    file = open('NOTES.TXT', 'r')
    Lines = file.readlines()
    for L in Lines:
        W = L.split()
        if len(W) == 5:
            print(L)
    file.close()
```

**Solution:** Each line is split into words using `.split()`. If the resulting list has exactly 5 elements, the line is printed. The third line has more than 5 words, so it is skipped.

---

### Q2(i).
Write a **Recursive** function in Python `RecsumNat(N)`, to return the sum of the first N natural numbers. *(3 marks)*

For example, if N is 10, then the function should return $(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 10 = 55)$.

**Answer:**

```python
def RecsumNat(N):
    if N == 1:
        return N
    else:
        return N + RecsumNat(N - 1)
```

**Solution:**
- **Base case:** If $N = 1$, return 1.
- **Recursive case:** Return $N + \text{RecsumNat}(N-1)$.

For $N = 10$: $10 + 9 + 8 + \cdots + 1 = 55$ ✓

**OR**

Write a **Recursive** function in Python `Power(X, N)`, to return the result of X raised to the power N where X and N are non-negative integers. *(3 marks)*

For example, if X is 5 and N is 3, the function should return $5^3 = 125$.

**Answer:**

```python
def Power(X, N):
    if N == 1:
        return X
    else:
        return X * Power(X, N - 1)
```

**Solution:**
- **Base case:** If $N = 1$, return $X$.
- **Recursive case:** Return $X \times \text{Power}(X, N-1)$.

For `Power(5, 3)`: $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$ ✓

---

### Q2(j).
Write functions in Python for `PushS(List)` and for `PopS(List)` for performing **Push** and **Pop** operations with a stack of List containing integers. *(4 marks)*

**Answer:**

```python
def PushS(List):
    N = int(input("Enter integer: "))
    List.append(N)

def PopS(List):
    if List == []:
        print("Stack empty")
    else:
        print("Deleted integer:", List.pop())
```

**Solution:**
- **PushS:** Takes an integer input from the user and appends it to the end of the list (top of stack). `append()` adds to the end, simulating a push.
- **PopS:** Checks if the stack is empty (underflow condition). If not, uses `pop()` to remove and return the last element (top of stack).

**OR**

Write functions in Python for `InsertQ(Names)` and for `RemoveQ(Names)` for performing insertion and removal operations with a **queue** of List which contains names of students. *(4 marks)*

**Answer:**

```python
def InsertQ(Names):
    Name = input("Enter Name to be inserted: ")
    Names.append(Name)

def RemoveQ(Names):
    if Names == []:
        print("Queue empty")
    else:
        print("Deleted Name is:", Names[0])
        del Names[0]
```

**Solution:**
- **InsertQ:** Inserts a name at the **rear** of the queue using `append()`.
- **RemoveQ:** Checks for underflow (empty queue). If not empty, displays and deletes the element at the **front** (index 0) using `del Names[0]`, following FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

---

### Q3. Fill in the blanks from questions 3(a) to 3(d):

---

### Q3(a).
Computers connected by a network across different cities is an example of _____________.  *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network)

**Solution:** A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) spans across multiple buildings or locations within a city or across different cities in a metropolitan region — larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

---

### Q3(b).
____________ is a network tool used to test the download and upload broadband speed. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** **Speedtest**

**Solution:** Speedtest (e.g., Speedtest.net by Ookla) is a widely used network diagnostic tool that measures the speed of an internet connection by testing upload and download bandwidth.

---

### Q3(c).
A ____________ is a networking device that connects computers in a network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** **Switch**

**Solution:** A network **Switch** operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It uses packet switching to receive data frames and forward them only to the specific device for which they are intended, unlike a hub which broadcasts to all.

---

### Q3(d).
____________ is a network tool used to determine the path packets taken from one IP address to another. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** **Traceroute**

**Solution:** `Traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows) is a network diagnostic command that tracks the route that packets take from the source to the destination IP address, displaying each hop (intermediate router) along the way.

---

### Q3(g).
What is **secure communication**? Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS. *(3 marks)*

**Answer:**

**Secure Communication:** Secure communication is when two entities are communicating and do not want a third party to listen in, intercept, or tamper with the data being exchanged. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data.

**Difference between HTTP and HTTPS:**

| HTTP | HTTPS |
|------|-------|
| HyperText Transfer Protocol | HyperText Transfer Protocol **Secure** |
| Data is transmitted in **plain text** | Data is transmitted in **encrypted** form |
| **Not secure** — vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks | **Secure** — uses TLS/SSL certificates for authentication and encryption |
| Default port: **80** | Default port: **443** |
| No certificate required | Requires an SSL/TLS certificate |

---

### Q3(h).

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A Star Topology network layout with Mumbai H.O. at the centre. Three lines radiate outward connecting directly to: Delhi Branch (top), Kolkata Branch (right), and Chennai Branch (bottom). Mumbai H.O. acts as the central hub connecting all branch offices directly.]

**Solution:** The best layout is a **Star Topology** with Mumbai H.O. at the centre, directly connected to each branch office (Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai). This provides centralised control, easy fault detection, and efficient data routing. The shortest/most direct connections are Mumbai–Delhi (1420 km), Mumbai–Kolkata (1640 km), and Mumbai–Chennai (2710 km).

---

#### Q3(h)(ii).
Suggest the most suitable location to install the main server of this NGO to communicate data with all the offices. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** **Mumbai H.O.**

**Solution:** Mumbai H.O. has the largest number of computers (2500) and is the head office. Placing the main server here ensures centralised management and acts as the hub for all communications to and from the branch offices.

---

#### Q3(h)(iii).
Write the name of the type of network which will be formed by connecting all the computer systems across the network: *(1 mark)*

(A) WAN
(B) MAN
(C) LAN
(D) PAN

**Answer:** **(A) WAN**

**Solution:** Since the network spans across multiple cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai) spread across large geographical distances, it forms a **Wide Area Network (WAN)**.

---

#### Q3(h)(iv).
Suggest the most suitable medium for connecting the computers installed across the network: *(1 mark)*

(A) Optical fibre
(B) Telephone wires
(C) Radio waves
(D) Ethernet cable

**Answer:** **(A) Optical fibre**

**Solution:** For a WAN spanning thousands of kilometres between cities, **Optical Fibre** is the most suitable medium. It offers the highest bandwidth, fastest data transmission speeds, low signal loss over long distances, and is immune to electromagnetic interference — making it ideal for inter-city connections.

---

## Section C — Database and SQL

---

### Q4(a).
Which SQL command is used to **add a new attribute** in a table? *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** `ALTER TABLE`

**Solution:** The `ALTER TABLE` command is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command used to modify an existing table structure — for example, adding a new column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE TableName ADD ColumnName DataType;
```

---

### Q4(b).
Which SQL aggregate function is used to **count all records** of a table? *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** `COUNT(*)`

**Solution:** `COUNT(*)` counts all rows in a table, including those with NULL values. Example:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TableName;
```

---

### Q4(c).
Which clause is used with a `SELECT` command in SQL to display the records in **ascending order** of an attribute? *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** `ORDER BY`

**Solution:** The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set. By default (or with `ASC`), it sorts in ascending order. Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TableName ORDER BY AttributeName;
-- or explicitly:
SELECT * FROM TableName ORDER BY AttributeName ASC;
```

---

### Q4(d).
Write the full form of the following abbreviations: *(1 mark)*

(i) DDL
(ii) DML

**Answer:**
- (i) **DDL** — Data Definition Language
- (ii) **DML** — Data Manipulation Language

**Solution:**
- **DDL** includes commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` — used to define or modify database structure.
- **DML** includes commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` — used to manipulate data within tables.

---

### Q4(e).
Observe the following tables **EMPLOYEES** and **DEPARTMENT** carefully and answer the questions that follow: *(2 marks)*

**Table: EMPLOYEES**

| ENO | ENAME | DOJ | DNO |
|-----|-------|-----|-----|
| E1 | NUSRAT | 2001-11-21 | D3 |
| E2 | KABIR | 2005-10-25 | D1 |

**Table: DEPARTMENT**

| DNO | DNAME |
|-----|-------|
| D1 | ACCOUNTS |
| D2 | HR |
| D3 | ADMIN |

---

#### Q4(e)(i).
What is the **Degree** of the table EMPLOYEES? What is the **Cardinality** of the table DEPARTMENT?

**Answer:**
- **Degree of EMPLOYEES** = **4** (number of columns/attributes: ENO, ENAME, DOJ, DNO)
- **Cardinality of DEPARTMENT** = **3** (number of rows/tuples: D1, D2, D3)

**Solution:**
- **Degree** refers to the number of attributes (columns) in a relation.
- **Cardinality** refers to the number of tuples (rows) in a relation.

---

#### Q4(e)(ii).
What is a **Primary Key**? Explain.

**Answer:** A **Primary Key** is an attribute (or a set of attributes) of a table which has a **unique value** for each record in the table and **cannot contain NULL values**. It is used to uniquely identify each record/tuple in the relation.

**Solution:** In the EMPLOYEES table, `ENO` (E1, E2) serves as the Primary Key since each employee has a unique employee number. In DEPARTMENT, `DNO` is the Primary Key.

**OR**

**Differentiate between Selection and Projection operations in context of a Relational Database. Also, illustrate the difference with one supporting example of each.** *(2 marks)*

**Answer:**
