## Section A — 1 Mark Each (Objective Questions)

### Q1.
Which of the following methods can be used to establish a connection for data transfer between two computers over the Internet?

(a) SMTP
(b) HTTP
(c) FTP
(d) POP3

**Answer:** (c) FTP

**Solution:** FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is specifically used to transfer data files between computers over a TCP/IP network such as the Internet.

---

### Q2.
What is the output of the following Python code fragment?
```python
x = [3, 4, 5]
print(x[-1])
```
(a) 3
(b) 4
(c) 5
(d) Error

**Answer:** (c) 5

**Solution:** Index `-1` in Python refers to the last element of the list. The list `x = [3, 4, 5]` has `5` as its last element, so `x[-1]` returns `5`.

---

### Q3.
**Assertion (A):** In Object Oriented Programming, data hiding helps to protect object data from unauthorized access.

**Reason (R):** Data encapsulation is not supported in Python.

(a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
(b) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.
(c) A is true, but R is false.
(d) A is false, but R is true.

**Answer:** (c) A is true, but R is false.

**Solution:** The Assertion is correct — data hiding does protect object data from unauthorized access in OOP. However, the Reason is false because Python does support data encapsulation through the use of private and protected members (using `_` and `__` prefixes).

---

### Q4.
Which one of the following is not a valid attribute of a file in Python?

(a) `.close()`
(b) `.mode`
(c) `.write()`
(d) `.rename()`

**Answer:** (d) `.rename()`

**Solution:** `.rename()` is not a built-in file attribute or method in Python's file object. `.close()`, `.mode`, and `.write()` are all valid file methods/attributes. Renaming a file is done using `os.rename()` from the `os` module.

---

### Q5.
Which of the following relations is generally used to represent many-to-many relationships in a relational database?

(a) One-to-one
(b) Many-to-one
(c) Many-to-many
(d) One-to-many

**Answer:** (c) Many-to-many

**Solution:** Many-to-many relationships in a relational database require a separate associative (junction/bridge) table that holds foreign keys referencing both related tables.

---

### Q6.
Which of these keywords is used to define a class in Python?

(a) method
(b) function
(c) class
(d) obj

**Answer:** (c) class

**Solution:** The `class` keyword is the reserved keyword in Python used to define a class. For example: `class MyClass:`.

---

### Q7.
Which of the following is an example of a tuple in Python?

(a) `{1, 2, 3}`
(b) `[1, 2, 3]`
(c) `(1, 2, 3)`
(d) `"1, 2, 3"`

**Answer:** (c) `(1, 2, 3)`

**Solution:** Tuples in Python are denoted by parentheses `( )`. `{1, 2, 3}` is a set, `[1, 2, 3]` is a list, and `"1, 2, 3"` is a string.

---

### Q8.
Which SQL command is used to modify the records of a table?

(a) ALTER
(b) UPDATE
(c) MODIFY
(d) INSERT

**Answer:** (b) UPDATE

**Solution:** The `UPDATE` command is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command used to modify existing records in a table. `ALTER` modifies the structure of a table, not its records.

---

### Q9.
Select the correct abbreviation of DNS in networking.

(a) Data Network Service
(b) Domain Name System
(c) Distributed Name Service
(d) Domain Network System

**Answer:** (b) Domain Name System

**Solution:** DNS stands for **Domain Name System**. It is a hierarchical naming system that translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses.

---

### Q10.
Which of these protocols is used for secure file transfer over the Internet?

(a) FTP
(b) HTTP
(c) SFTP
(d) TELNET

**Answer:** (c) SFTP

**Solution:** SFTP stands for **Secure File Transfer Protocol**. Unlike regular FTP, SFTP encrypts both commands and data, providing secure file transfer over the Internet.

---

### Q11.
What is the result of: `10 // 3` in Python?

(a) 3.33
(b) 3
(c) 0
(d) 1

**Answer:** (b) 3

**Solution:** The `//` operator in Python performs **integer (floor) division**, which divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result. $10 \div 3 = 3.33...$, so `10 // 3` gives `3`.

---

### Q12.
Which of the following best defines the term "primary key" in a table?

(a) A field that uniquely identifies each record in a table
(b) A field that allows duplicate values
(c) A field that always remains empty
(d) None of these

**Answer:** (a) A field that uniquely identifies each record in a table

**Solution:** A primary key is a column (or combination of columns) in a relational table that uniquely identifies every row. It cannot contain `NULL` values and must be unique for each record.

---

### Q13.
Which method is used to add an element at the end of a list in Python?

(a) `append()`
(b) `push()`
(c) `insert()`
(d) `add()`

**Answer:** (a) `append()`

**Solution:** The `append()` method adds a single element to the **end** of a list. `insert()` adds at a specified position, while `push()` and `add()` are not valid Python list methods.

---

### Q14.
Which of the following denotes a many-to-one relationship?

(a) A student has a library card
(b) Many employees belong to one department
(c) Each book is written by many authors
(d) Each computer has multiple USB ports

**Answer:** (b) Many employees belong to one department

**Solution:** A many-to-one relationship means multiple instances of one entity are associated with a single instance of another. "Many employees belong to one department" perfectly describes this — many employees map to one department.

---

### Q15.
Which built-in function can be used to find the largest item in a list in Python?

(a) `max()`
(b) `top()`
(c) `large()`
(d) `maximum()`

**Answer:** (a) `max()`

**Solution:** The built-in function `max()` returns the largest item from an iterable (such as a list). `top()`, `large()`, and `maximum()` are not valid Python built-in functions.

---

### Q16.
In SQL, which clause is used to filter records?

(a) WHERE
(b) SELECT
(c) ORDER BY
(d) GROUP BY

**Answer:** (a) WHERE

**Solution:** The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records in SQL based on specified conditions. `SELECT` retrieves data, `ORDER BY` sorts results, and `GROUP BY` groups rows sharing a property.

---

### Q17.
Select the odd one out.

(a) Optical Fibre
(b) Coaxial Cable
(c) Bluetooth
(d) Twisted Pair

**Answer:** (c) Bluetooth

**Solution:** Bluetooth is a **wireless** (unguided) transmission medium, while Optical Fibre, Coaxial Cable, and Twisted Pair are all **wired** (guided) transmission media. Hence, Bluetooth is the odd one out.

---

### Q18.
In Python, what data structure is best suited for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations?

(a) Queue
(b) Stack
(c) Dictionary
(d) List only

**Answer:** (b) Stack

**Solution:** A **Stack** follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. A Queue follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out). In Python, a stack can be implemented using a list with `append()` and `pop()`.

---

### Q19.
Which SQL query will remove all records from a table named `Students`, but keep the table structure?

(a) `DELETE * FROM Students;`
(b) `DROP Students;`
(c) `TRUNCATE TABLE Students;`
(d) `REMOVE Students;`

**Answer:** (c) `TRUNCATE TABLE Students;`

**Solution:** `TRUNCATE TABLE Students;` removes all rows from the table but preserves the table structure (schema). `DROP` would delete the entire table including its structure, and `DELETE *` and `REMOVE` are not valid SQL syntax.

---

## Section B — 2 Marks Each (Short Answer Questions)

### Q1.
Differentiate between static and dynamic typing in Python with suitable examples.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Static Typing | Dynamic Typing |
|---|---|---|
| Type Declaration | Explicitly declared at compile time | Determined at runtime |
| Type Flexibility | Variable type is fixed | Variable can change type |
| Example Language | C, Java | Python |

**Example of Static Typing (C language):**
```c
int a = 5;  // type is fixed as integer
```

**Example of Dynamic Typing (Python):**
```python
a = 5        # a is integer
a = "String" # a is now a string — allowed in Python
```

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is determined at runtime and can change during execution.

---

### Q2.
What is the significance of the `self` keyword in defining class methods in Python?

**Answer:**

The `self` keyword in Python refers to the **current instance** of the class. It is used to:

1. **Access instance variables** — `self.name`, `self.age`, etc.
2. **Call other instance methods** — `self.method_name()`

It must be the **first parameter** of every instance method in a class.

**Example:**
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # instance variable

    def display(self):
        print(self.name)  # accessing instance variable using self
```

Without `self`, Python would not know which object's data to access or modify.

---

### Q3.
Explain the purpose of the `HAVING` clause in SQL.

**Answer:**

The `HAVING` clause in SQL is used to **filter records after aggregation** (i.e., after `GROUP BY` has been applied). It is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but:

- `WHERE` filters rows **before** grouping/aggregation.
- `HAVING` filters groups **after** the `GROUP BY` aggregation.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmpCount
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

This query returns only those departments that have more than 5 employees.

---

### Q4.
Find the output of the following code:
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(my_dict.get('b', 0))
```

**Answer:** `2`

**Solution:** The `get()` method returns the **value associated with the given key** if the key exists in the dictionary. Here, the key `'b'` exists in `my_dict` with a value of `2`. The second argument `0` is the default value returned only if the key is **not found**. Since `'b'` is present, the output is `2`.

---

### Q5.
State two advantages of using functions in programming.

**Answer:**

1. **Code Reusability:** Functions allow the same block of code to be used multiple times throughout a program without rewriting it, reducing redundancy.

2. **Modularity and Easier Debugging:** Functions break a large program into smaller, manageable modules. Each module can be tested and debugged independently, making the overall program easier to maintain and troubleshoot.

---

### Q6.
Write one difference between `read()` and `readline()` methods for file objects in Python.

**Answer:**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `read()` | Reads the **entire content** of the file as a single string. |
| `readline()` | Reads only **one line** at a time from the file. |

**Example:**
```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")
content = f.read()      # reads entire file
line = f.readline()     # reads only one line
```

---

### Q7.
What will be displayed after executing the following code?
```python
A = [9, 8, 7]
A.pop()
print(A)
```

**Answer:** `[9, 8]`

**Solution:** The `pop()` method, when called without any argument, removes and returns the **last element** of the list. The last element of `A = [9, 8, 7]` is `7`. After `A.pop()`, the list becomes `[9, 8]`, which is then printed.

---

### Q8.
Explain any two application areas of DBMS.

**Answer:**

1. **Banking Systems:** DBMS is used to manage customer accounts, transactions, loan records, and financial data. It ensures data integrity, security, and concurrent access for multiple users.

2. **Airlines and Reservation Systems:** DBMS manages flight schedules, passenger bookings, seat availability, and cancellations in real time, supporting simultaneous access by thousands of users.

---

### Q9.
What is normalization? Why is it important in database design?

**Answer:**

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a database to **reduce redundancy** and **improve data integrity**. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, well-structured tables and defining relationships between them.

**Importance:**
- **Eliminates data redundancy:** Avoids storing the same data in multiple places.
- **Ensures data consistency:** Updates need to be made in only one place.
- **Improves data integrity:** Prevents anomalies during insertion, deletion, and update operations.
- **Optimizes storage:** Reduces unnecessary duplication of data.

---

### Q10.
Give any two differences between LAN and WAN.

**Answer:**

| Feature | LAN (Local Area Network) | WAN (Wide Area Network) |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage Area** | Limited area — office, school, or small building | Large geographic areas — cities, countries, or continents |
| **Speed** | Typically higher speed (100 Mbps – 1 Gbps) | Generally slower due to long distances |
| **Cost** | Less expensive to set up and maintain | More expensive to set up and maintain |
| **Ownership** | Usually privately owned | Often uses public/leased telecommunication lines |

---

### Q11.
Write the output of:
```python
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i, end=" ")
```

**Answer:** `2 3 4 5`

**Solution:** `range(2, 6)` generates numbers starting from `2` up to (but **not including**) `6`, i.e., `2, 3, 4, 5`. The `end=" "` argument in `print()` replaces the default newline with a space, so all values are printed on the same line separated by spaces.

---

### Q12.
If you want to access keys of a dictionary named `"data"`, which method will you use? Show with code.

**Answer:**

The `keys()` method is used to access all the keys of a dictionary.

```python
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}
print(data.keys())
# Output: dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'grade'])
```

The `keys()` method returns a **view object** containing all the keys of the dictionary.

---

### Q13.
Name any two fields (attributes) suitable for a table named `"Employee"`.

**Answer:**

Two suitable fields/attributes for an `Employee` table:

1. **`EmpID`** — A unique identifier for each employee (can serve as Primary Key).
2. **`EmpName`** — Stores the full name of the employee.

Other valid examples include: `Department`, `Salary`, `Designation`, `DateOfJoining`.

---

### Q14.
How are comments written in Python? What is their use?

**Answer:**

**Single-line comments** in Python begin with the `#` symbol. Everything after `#` on that line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # This assigns 10 to x
```

**Multi-line comments** can be written using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`):
```python
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

**Uses of Comments:**
- To **explain** what the code does, making it more readable and understandable.
- To **temporarily disable** lines of code during debugging without deleting them.

---

### Q15.
Write an SQL query to fetch names of students from `"Student"` table where marks are more than 90.

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Student
WHERE marks > 90;
```

**Explanation:** The `SELECT` clause specifies the column to retrieve (`name`), the `FROM` clause specifies the table (`Student`), and the `WHERE` clause filters the records to include only those where `marks > 90`.

---

### Q16.
State the differences between a `'switch'` hub and a `'router'`.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Switch | Router |
|---|---|---|
| **Function** | Forwards data packets within the **same network** (LAN) | Connects **multiple networks** and routes data between them |
| **Layer** | Operates at **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2) of OSI model | Operates at **Network Layer** (Layer 3) of OSI model |
| **Addressing** | Uses **MAC addresses** to forward data | Uses **IP addresses** to route data |
| **Usage** | Used within a single local network | Used to connect different networks (e.g., LAN to Internet) |

---

### Q17.
Define open source software. Give one example.

**Answer:**

**Open Source Software** is software whose **source code is freely available** to the public. Anyone can view, modify, use, and distribute the software, usually under an open-source license.

**Key Features:**
- Free to use and distribute
- Source code is publicly accessible
- Community-driven development and support

**Example:** **Linux** (operating system) — Its source code is freely available and can be modified and redistributed by anyone.

Other examples: Python, Mozilla Firefox, LibreOffice.

---

### Q18.
Explain any one difference between procedural and object-oriented programming.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Focuses on **functions/procedures** and the sequence of instructions to be executed | Focuses on **objects** that combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) |
| **Data Handling** | Data is shared across functions and is less secure | Data is encapsulated within objects, providing better security through data hiding |

**Example:**
- *Procedural (C):* Programs are structured as a series of function calls.
- *OOP (Python):* Programs are structured around classes and objects that model real-world entities.

---

### Q19.
How does the `break` statement work inside a `for` loop in Python?

**Answer:**

The `break` statement is used to **immediately exit a loop** when a specified condition is met, regardless of whether the loop has completed all its iterations.

**Working:** When `break` is encountered inside a `for` loop, Python **terminates the loop** and transfers control to the first statement **after** the loop body.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break        # exits loop when i equals 5
    print(i)
# Output: 1 2 3 4
```

The loop stops at `i = 5`, skipping all remaining iterations (`6, 7, 8, 9`).

---

### Q20.
What is data redundancy? Suggest one way to reduce it.

**Answer:**

**Data Redundancy** refers to the **unnecessary duplication of data** — storing the same data in multiple places within a database. This wastes storage space, increases the risk of inconsistency, and makes updates difficult (same data must be updated in multiple locations).

**Example:** Storing a student's address in both the `Student` table and the `Library` table.

**Way to Reduce It:**
**Normalization** — Organizing the database into multiple related tables and using foreign keys to establish relationships, ensuring each piece of data is stored only once.

---

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q1.
Write a Python function to check if a string passed to it is a palindrome or not. Show with example.

**Answer:**

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Function to check if a string is a palindrome.
    A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
    """
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Examples
print(is_palindrome('level'))   # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('madam'))   # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('test'))    # Output: False
print(is_palindrome('racecar')) # Output: True
```

**Explanation:**
- `s[::-1]` creates a **reversed copy** of the string using slicing with step `-1`.
- If the original string equals its reverse, it is a palindrome and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

---

### Q2.
Explain the various join operations available in SQL. Give an example of any one join.

**Answer:**

SQL provides the following types of JOIN operations:

| Join Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns only the rows where there is a **matching value** in both tables |
| **LEFT JOIN** (Left Outer Join) | Returns **all rows from the left table** and matching rows from the right table; non-matching right table rows show NULL |
| **RIGHT JOIN** (Right Outer Join) | Returns **all rows from the right table** and matching rows from the left table; non-matching left table rows show NULL |
| **FULL JOIN** (Full Outer Join) | Returns all rows from **both tables**; non-matching rows on either side show NULL |

**Example — INNER JOIN:**

```sql
SELECT Students.name, Marks.score
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Marks
ON Students.id = Marks.student_id;
```

**Explanation:** This query retrieves student names and their scores by matching `Students.id` with `Marks.student_id`. Only students who have a corresponding entry in the `Marks` table are returned.

---

### Q3.
How is exception handling achieved in Python? Illustrate with a simple example for `ZeroDivisionError`.

**Answer:**

Exception handling in Python is achieved using the `try...except` block:

- **`try` block:** Contains the code that might raise an exception.
- **`except` block:** Contains code to handle the exception if it occurs.
- **`else` block** *(optional):* Executes if no exception occurs.
- **`finally` block** *(optional):* Always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.

**Example — Handling `ZeroDivisionError`:**

```python
try:
    numerator = 10
    denominator = 0
    result = numerator / denominator   # This raises ZeroDivisionError
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```

**Output:**
```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
Execution completed.
```

Without exception handling, the program would **crash** with a `ZeroDivisionError`. The `except` block gracefully handles the error and allows the program to continue.

---

### Q4.
List three differences between a list and a tuple in Python.

**Answer:**

| Feature | List | Tuple |
|---|---|---|
| **Mutability** | **Mutable** — elements can be added, removed, or changed after creation | **Immutable** — elements cannot be changed once the tuple is created |
| **Syntax** | Defined using **square brackets** `[ ]` | Defined using **parentheses** `( )` |
| **Methods** | Supports many methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, etc. | Has limited methods — only `count()` and `index()` |
| **Performance** | Slightly **slower** due to mutability overhead | **Faster** than lists for iteration and access |
| **Use Case** | Used for **homogeneous, dynamic** collections that may change | Used for **heterogeneous, fixed** collections like coordinates or records |

---

### Q5.
Write a short note on the importance of cybersecurity in online transactions.

**Answer:**

**Cybersecurity** refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage.

**Importance in Online Transactions:**

1. **Protection from Fraud:** Cybersecurity measures like **encryption** (e.g., SSL/TLS) ensure that financial data such as credit card numbers and bank account details are transmitted securely, preventing fraud.

2. **Prevention of Unauthorized Access:** **Authentication mechanisms** (passwords, two-factor authentication) ensure that only authorized users can access accounts and perform transactions.

3. **Data Integrity:** Cybersecurity ensures that data is **not tampered with** during transmission. Digital signatures and hashing verify that transaction data remains unchanged.

4. **Privacy Protection:** Measures like **firewalls** and **data encryption** protect personal and financial information from being intercepted by malicious actors.

5. **Building User Trust:** Secure systems encourage users to engage in online commerce with confidence, which is vital for the growth of e-commerce.

In summary, cybersecurity is the backbone of safe online transactions, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial data.

### Q6.
From the following table `"Books"`, write an SQL query to display the title and price of books where the author is `'Ravi Kumar'`.

| BookID | Title | Author | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Python Magic | Ravi Kumar | 400 |
| 2 | Web Wonders | Sonia Jain | 410 |
| 3 | SQL Power | Ravi Kumar | 350 |

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT Title, Price
FROM Books
WHERE Author = 'Ravi Kumar';
```

**Expected Output:**

| Title | Price |
|---|---|
| Python Magic | 400 |
| SQL Power | 350 |

**Explanation:** The `WHERE` clause filters rows to return only those where `Author = 'Ravi Kumar'`. The `SELECT` clause retrieves only the `Title` and `Price` columns from those filtered rows.

---

### Q7.
Identify and correct the error(s) in the following declaration:
```python
student = (RollNo: 101, 'Name': 'Arjun', 'Marks': 87.5)
```

**Answer:**

**Errors Identified:**

1. **Wrong brackets:** Parentheses `( )` are used, which denotes a tuple. For key-value pairs, **curly braces** `{ }` should be used (dictionary syntax).
2. **Missing quotes around key `RollNo`:** Dictionary keys that are strings must be enclosed in quotes. `RollNo` should be `'RollNo'`.

**Corrected Declaration:**
```python
student = {'RollNo': 101, 'Name': 'Arjun', 'Marks': 87.5}
```

This is a valid Python **dictionary** with three key-value pairs: `RollNo`, `Name`, and `Marks`.

---

### Q8.
What is a foreign key? How does it help maintain referential integrity in relational databases?

**Answer:**

**Foreign Key:**
A **foreign key** is a column (or set of columns) in one table that **refers to the primary key** in another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a parent-child relationship.

**Example:**
```
Table: Student (StudentID [PK], Name, ClassID [FK])
Table: Class   (ClassID [PK], ClassName)
```
Here, `ClassID` in the `Student` table is a foreign key referencing `ClassID` in the `Class` table.

**Maintaining Referential Integrity:**
A foreign key ensures **referential integrity** by:

1. **Preventing invalid entries:** You cannot insert a value in the foreign key column that does not exist in the referenced primary key column.
2. **Preventing orphan records:** You cannot delete a record from the parent table if a related record exists in the child table (unless cascading is configured).
3. **Ensuring consistent relationships:** Any update to a primary key is properly cascaded or restricted to maintain consistency.

---

### Q9.
Explain the three layers of the client-server architecture with a diagram.

**Answer:**

The **three-tier client-server architecture** divides an application into three logical layers:

**1. Presentation Layer (Client Tier):**
- The topmost layer — the user interface.
- Responsible for displaying data to the user and collecting user input.
- Example: Web browser, mobile app.

**2. Application Layer (Logic/Business Tier):**
- The middle layer containing business logic.
- Processes user requests, performs calculations, and coordinates between the presentation and data layers.
- Example: Web server, application server.

**3. Data Layer (Database Tier):**
- The bottom layer responsible for data storage and retrieval.
- Manages databases and handles queries.
- Example: MySQL, Oracle database server.

[Diagram: Three-tier architecture showing:
- **Client (UI)** ⇄ sends/receives requests/responses ⇄ **Application Server (Business Logic)** ⇄ sends/receives queries/results ⇄ **Database Server (Data Storage)**
- Arrows showing bidirectional communication between each adjacent layer.]

### Q10.
Write a Python code segment to copy the content of one text file to another.

**Answer:**

```python
# Open source file in read mode and destination file in write mode
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as source_file, open('file2.txt', 'w') as dest_file:
    for line in source_file:        # read line by line from source
        dest_file.write(line)       # write each line to destination

print("File copied successfully.")
```

**Alternative using `read()`:**
```python
with open('file1.txt', 'r') as source_file:
    content = source_file.read()    # read entire content at once

with open('file2.txt', 'w') as dest_file:
    dest_file.write(content)        # write entire content to destination

print("File copied successfully.")
```

**Explanation:**
- `open('file1.txt', 'r')` opens the source file in **read mode**.
- `open('file2.txt', 'w')` opens/creates the destination file in **write mode**.
- The `with` statement ensures files are properly **closed** after the operation, even if an error occurs.

## Section D — Case Study / Source-Based Questions

### Q1.
**Passage:**
*At Zenith School, there is an online student management system that allows teachers and students to access various academic and administrative records. The system is built using Python for its backend logic, and MySQL as the database. All records are stored securely, and data backup is performed weekly. The IT team uses various network devices such as switches and routers to maintain connectivity across different blocks. To ensure safety, regular training on cybersecurity is provided to users.*

**(a)** Name any two features of MySQL that make it suitable for use in the system described above.

**Answer:**

1. **Transaction Support (ACID Compliance):** MySQL supports transactions that ensure data integrity. Operations like student record updates are handled reliably — either fully completed or fully rolled back in case of failure, ensuring consistency.

2. **Robust Security and Access Control:** MySQL provides user-based access control, allowing different levels of access to be granted to teachers, students, and administrators. This ensures that sensitive academic records are protected from unauthorized access.

**(b)** Suggest two ways to enhance security for the online records of students.

**Answer:**

1. **Strong Password Policy and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enforcing complex passwords and implementing two-factor authentication ensures that only authorized users (teachers and students) can access the system, even if a password is compromised.

2. **Data Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive student data both in storage (at rest) and during transmission (in transit using HTTPS/SSL) prevents unauthorized interception and protects student privacy.

**(c)** State the difference between a switch and a router, relevant to the scenario above.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Switch | Router |
|---|---|---|
| **Function** | Connects devices **within the same network block** (e.g., computers in the same building) and forwards data using MAC addresses | Connects **multiple different networks** (e.g., different school blocks or the school network to the Internet) and routes data using IP addresses |
| **Relevance to Scenario** | Used to connect computers within each school block to form a local network | Used to connect different school blocks together and to the external Internet |

**In the Zenith School scenario:** Switches are used to connect computers within each block (local connectivity), while routers connect the different blocks to each other and to the wider Internet, enabling the online student management system to be accessed school-wide.

### Q1.
Describe, with an example, how the concept of inheritance is implemented in object-oriented programming using Python. Why is inheritance useful?

**Answer:**

**Inheritance** is one of the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a new class (called the **child class** or **derived class**) to acquire the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (called the **parent class** or **base class**).

**Syntax:**
```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # additional attributes and methods
    pass
```

**Types of Inheritance in Python:**
1. **Single Inheritance:** One child inherits from one parent.
2. **Multiple Inheritance:** One child inherits from multiple parents.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a derived class (chain).
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from one parent.

---

**Example — Single Inheritance:**

```python
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   # instance variable

    def sound(self):
        print(f"{self.name} makes a generic sound.")

    def breathe(self):
        print(f"{self.name} breathes oxygen.")

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):      # Method Overriding
        print(f"{self.name} says: Bark!")

    def fetch(self):      # New method in child class
        print(f"{self.name} fetches the ball.")

# Child class inheriting from Animal
class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):      # Method Overriding
        print(f"{self.name} says: Meow!")

# Creating objects
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

dog.sound()      # Output: Buddy says: Bark!
dog.breathe()    # Output: Buddy breathes oxygen. (inherited from Animal)
dog.fetch()      # Output: Buddy fetches the ball. (Dog's own method)

cat.sound()      # Output: Whiskers says: Meow!
cat.breathe()    # Output: Whiskers breathes oxygen. (inherited from Animal)
```

**Output:**
```
Buddy says: Bark!
Buddy breathes oxygen.
Buddy fetches the ball.
Whiskers says: Meow!
Whiskers breathes oxygen.
```

**Why is Inheritance Useful?**

1. **Code Reusability:** Common attributes and methods defined in the parent class (like `breathe()`) are automatically available to all child classes without rewriting them, saving time and effort.

2. **Extensibility:** Child classes can add new features or **override** existing parent methods (as `Dog` and `Cat` override `sound()`), making it easy to extend existing functionality.

3. **Hierarchical Classification:** Inheritance allows modeling real-world hierarchical relationships (e.g., Animal → Dog → GoldenRetriever), making code more intuitive and organized.

4. **Reduced Redundancy:** Common code is written once in the parent class, reducing duplication and making maintenance easier. If `breathe()` needs updating, only the parent class needs to be changed.

5. **Polymorphism Support:** Inheritance enables polymorphism — the same method name (`sound()`) behaves differently in `Dog` and `Cat`, making programs more flexible and scalable.
