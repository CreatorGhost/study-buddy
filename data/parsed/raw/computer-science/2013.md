## Section 1 — Questions Q1 (Sub-parts)

### Q1(a) — 2 Marks

What is the benefit of using function prototype for a function? Give a suitable example to illustrate it using C++ code.

**Answer:**
A function prototype is used to inform the compiler of a function declared somewhere in the program later after its call is made in the program.

**Solution:**

```cpp
void func();   // function prototype

void main() {
    func();
}

void func() {
    cout << "Function declaration.";
}
```

### Q1(b) — 1 Mark

Observe the following C++ code and write the name(s) of the header file(s), which will be essentially required to run it in a C++ compiler:

```cpp
void main()
{
    int Number;
    cin >> Number;
    if (abs(Number) == Number);
        cout << "Positive" << endl;
}
```

**Answer:** `math.h` and `iostream.h` are the required header files for the given code.

---

### Q1(c) — 2 Marks

Observe the following C++ code carefully and rewrite the same after removing all the syntax error(s) present in the code. Ensure that you underline each correction in the code.

> **Important Note:**
> - All the desired header files are already included, which are required to run the code.
> - Correction should not change the logic of the program.

```cpp
#define Convert (P,Q) P+2*Q;
void main ()
{
    Float A, B, Result;
    cin>>A>>B;
    Result=Convert [A,B]
    cout<<"Output:"<<Result<<endline;
}
```

**Answer / Corrected Code:**

```cpp
#define Convert (P,Q) P+2*Q;

void main ()
{
    float A, B, Result;          // 'Float' corrected to 'float'
    cin >> A >> B;
    Result = Convert(A, B);      // '[A,B]' corrected to '(A,B)'
    cout << "Output :" << Result << endl;  // 'endline' corrected to 'endl'
}
```

**Corrections Made:**
1. `Float` → `float` (C++ keywords are lowercase)
2. `Convert [A,B]` → `Convert(A,B)` (macro invocation uses parentheses, not square brackets)
3. `endline` → `endl` (correct C++ manipulator name)

---

### Q1(d) — 3 Marks

Observe the following C++ code carefully and obtain the output, which will appear on the screen after execution of it.

> **Important Note:** All the desired header files are already included in the code, which are required to run the code.

```cpp
void main ( )
{
    char *String = "SHAKTI";
    int *Point, Value[] = {10, 15, 70, 19};

    Point = Value;
    cout << *Point << String << endl;
    String++;
    Point++;
    cout << *Point << String << endl;
}
```

**Answer:**

```
10SHAKTI
15HAKTI
```

**Solution:**

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| `Point = Value` | `Point` points to `Value[0]` = 10 |
| `*Point` = 10, `String` = "SHAKTI" | First line prints `10SHAKTI` |
| `String++` | `String` now points to 'H', so `String` = "HAKTI" |
| `Point++` | `Point` now points to `Value[1]` = 15 |
| `*Point` = 15, `String` = "HAKTI" | Second line prints `15HAKTI` |

### Q1(e) — 3 Marks

Observe the following C++ code carefully and obtain the output, which will appear on the screen after execution of it.

```cpp
#include<iostream.h>

class Aroundus
{
    int Place, Humidity, Temp;
public:
    Aroundus(int P=2) { Place=P; Humidity=60; Temp=20; }
    void Hot(int T)   { Temp += T; }
    void Humid(int H) { Humidity += H; }
    void JustSee()
    {
        cout << Place << ":" << Temp << "&" << Humidity << "%" << endl;
    }
};

void main ( )
{
    Aroundus A, B(5);
    A.Hot(10);
    A.JustSee();
    B.Humid(15);
    B.Hot(2);
    B.JustSee();
    A.Humid(5);
    A.JustSee();
}
```

**Answer:**

```
2:30&60%
5:22&75%
2:30&65%
```

**Solution:**

| Object | Initial State | Operations | Final State at JustSee() |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Place=2, Temp=20, Humidity=60 | `Hot(10)` → Temp=30 | `2:30&60%` |
| B | Place=5, Temp=20, Humidity=60 | `Humid(15)` → Humidity=75; `Hot(2)` → Temp=22 | `5:22&75%` |
| A | Place=2, Temp=30, Humidity=60 | `Humid(5)` → Humidity=65 | `2:30&65%` |

### Q1(f) — 2 Marks

Based on the following C++ code, find out the expected correct output(s) from the options (i) to (iv). Also, find out the minimum and the maximum value that can be assigned to the variable `Trick` used in the code, at the time when the value of `Count` is 3.

```cpp
void main()
{
    char Status[][10] = {"EXCEL", "GOOD", "OK"};
    int Turn = 10, Trick;
    for(int Count = 1; Count < 4; Count++)
    {
        Trick = random(Count);
        cout << Turn - Trick << Status[Trick] << "#";
    }
}
```

Options:
- (i) `10EXCEL#10EXCEL#8OK#`
- (ii) `10EXCEL#8OK#9GOOD#`
- (iii) `10EXCEL#9GOOD#10EXCEL#`
- (iv) `10EXCEL#10GOOD#8OK#`

**Answer:** Options **(i)** and **(iii)** are the expected correct outputs.

**Solution:**

- `random(Count)` generates a random number in the range $[0, \text{Count}-1]$.
- When `Count = 1`: `Trick` can only be **0** → prints `10EXCEL#`
- When `Count = 2`: `Trick` can be **0 or 1** → prints `10EXCEL#` or `9GOOD#`
- When `Count = 3`: `Trick` can be **0, 1, or 2** → prints `10EXCEL#`, `9GOOD#`, or `8OK#`

**When Count = 3:**
- **Minimum value of Trick = 0**
- **Maximum value of Trick = 2**

> Note: Option (iv) is invalid because when `Count=2`, `random(2)` cannot produce a value giving `10GOOD#` (that would require `Trick=0` with `Status[0]="EXCEL"`, not "GOOD"). Option (ii) is invalid because the first iteration always gives `10EXCEL#`.

## Section 2 — Questions Q2 (Sub-parts)

### Q2(a) — 2 Marks

Write any two differences between Constructor and Destructor. Write the function headers for constructor and destructor of a class `Member`.

**Answer:**

| Constructors | Destructors |
|---|---|
| Constructors are used to initialise the data members of the class. | Destructors are used to free the memory occupied by the object of the class. |
| Constructors of a class can be overloaded. | Destructors cannot be overloaded. Each class will have only one destructor. |

**Function Headers for class `Member`:**

```cpp
class Member {
public:
    Member();   // Constructor
    ~Member();  // Destructor
};
```

---

### Q2(b) — 2 Marks

Answer the questions (i) and (ii) after going through the following class:

```cpp
class Motor
{
    int MotorNo, Track;
public:
    Motor();             // Function 1
    Motor(int MN);       // Function 2
    Motor(Motor &M);     // Function 3
    void Allocate();     // Function 4
    void Move();         // Function 5
};

void main()
{
    Motor M;
    :
    :
}
```

**(i)** Out of the following, which option is correct for calling Function 2?

- Option 1 — `Motor N(M);`
- Option 2 — `Motor P(10);`

**Answer:** **Option 2** — `Motor P(10);` is the correct call to Function 2.

**Solution:** Function 2 is `Motor(int MN)`, which takes an integer argument. `Motor P(10)` passes the integer `10`. Option 1 (`Motor N(M)`) passes an object of type `Motor`, which matches Function 3 (copy constructor), not Function 2.

---

**(ii)** Name the feature of Object Oriented Programming which is illustrated by Function 1, Function 2 and Function 3 combined together.

**Answer:** **Function Overloading** (also called **Polymorphism**) is the OOP feature illustrated by Functions 1, 2, and 3 combined together — since all three are constructors with different parameter lists (constructor overloading).

---

### Q2(c) — 4 Marks

Define a class `Tourist` in C++ with the following specifications:

**Data Members:**
- `Carno` — to store Bus No
- `Origin` — to store Place name of origin
- `Destination` — to store Place name of destination
- `Type` — to store Bus Type such as `'E'` for Economy
- `Distance` — to store the Distance in Kilometres
- `Charge` — to store the Car Fare

**Member Functions:**
- A constructor function to initialize `Type` as `'E'` and `Charge` as `250`
- A function `CalcCharge()` to calculate Fare as per the following criteria:

| TYPE | FARE |
|---|---|
| `'E'` | $16 \times \text{Distance}$ |
| `'A'` | $22 \times \text{Distance}$ |
| `'L'` | $30 \times \text{Distance}$ |

- A function `Enter()` to allow user to enter values for `Carno`, `Origin`, `Destination`, `Type` and `Distance`. Also, this function should call `CalcCharge()` to calculate Fare.
- A function `Show()` to display the content of all the data members on screen.

**Answer:**

```cpp
class Tourist
{
    int Carno;
    float Distance, Charge;
    char Origin[20], Destination[20];
    char Type;

    void CalcCharge()
    {
        if (Type == 'E')
            Charge = 16 * Distance;
        else if (Type == 'A')
            Charge = 22 * Distance;
        else if (Type == 'L')
            Charge = 30 * Distance;
    }

public:
    Tourist()
    {
        Type   = 'E';
        Charge = 250;
    }

    void Enter()
    {
        cout << "Enter Bus number: ";
        cin >> Carno;
        cout << "Enter Place name of origin: ";
        cin >> Origin;
        cout << "Enter Place name of destination: ";
        cin >> Destination;
        cout << "Enter Distance: ";
        cin >> Distance;
        cout << "Enter Type (E / A / L): ";
        cin >> Type;
        CalcCharge();
    }

    void Show()
    {
        cout << "Bus number: "             << Carno       << endl;
        cout << "Origin place name: "      << Origin      << endl;
        cout << "Destination place name: " << Destination << endl;
        cout << "Distance: "               << Distance    << endl;
        cout << "Type: "                   << Type        << endl;
        cout << "Charge: "                 << Charge      << endl;
    }
};
```

### Q2(d) — 4 Marks

Consider the following C++ code and answer the questions (i) to (iv):

```cpp
class Student
{
    int Class, Rno;
    char Section;
protected:
    char SName[20];
public:
    Student();
    void Stentry();
    void Stdisplay();
};

class Score : private Student
{
    float Marks[5];
protected:
    char Grade[5];
public:
    Score();
    void Sentry();
    void Sdisplay();
};

class Report : public Score
{
    float Total, Avg;
public:
    char OverallGrade, Remarks[20];
    Report();
    void REvaluate();
    void RPrint();
};
```

**(i)** Which type of Inheritance is shown in the above example?

**Answer:** **Multilevel Inheritance** is used in the above example.
(`Student` → `Score` → `Report`)

---

**(ii)** Write the names of those data members which can be directly accessed from the objects of class `Report`.

**Answer:** Only **`OverallGrade`** and **`Remarks`** can be directly accessed from objects of class `Report` (they are the only `public` data members of `Report`).

**Solution:** `Total` and `Avg` are `private` in `Report`. All members inherited from `Score` (including `Grade` which was `protected`) and from `Student` are either private or become inaccessible due to `private` inheritance of `Score` from `Student`, and `public` inheritance of `Report` from `Score` only exposes `Score`'s `public` interface.

---

**(iii)** Write the names of those member functions which can be directly accessed from the objects of class `Report`.

**Answer:** The following member functions can be directly accessed from objects of class `Report`:
- `REvaluate()`
- `RPrint()`
- `Sentry()`
- `Sdisplay()`

**Solution:** `Score` is inherited `privately` by... wait — `Report` inherits `Score` with `public` inheritance, so `Score`'s `public` functions (`Sentry()`, `Sdisplay()`) remain `public` in `Report`. `Report`'s own public functions `REvaluate()` and `RPrint()` are also accessible. Functions from `Student` (`Stentry()`, `Stdisplay()`) are inaccessible because `Score` privately inherits `Student`.

---

**(iv)** Write the names of those data members which can be directly accessed from the `Sentry()` function of class `Score`.

**Answer:** The following data members can be directly accessed from the `Sentry()` function of class `Score`:
- `SName` (inherited as `protected` from `Student`, accessible inside `Score`)
- `Marks` (private member of `Score`)
- `Grade` (protected member of `Score`)

## Section 3 — Questions Q3 (Sub-parts)

### Q3(a) — 3 Marks

Write code for a function `void Convert(int T[], int Num)` in C++, which re-positions all the elements of the array by shifting each of them to one position before and by shifting the first element to the last position.

For example, if the content of array is:

| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value | 22 | 25 | 70 | 32 | 12 |

The content will become:

| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value | 25 | 70 | 32 | 12 | 22 |

**Answer:**

```cpp
void Convert(int T[], int Num)
{
    int C = T[0], i;
    for (i = 0; i < Num - 1; i++)
        T[i] = T[i + 1];
    T[Num - 1] = C;

    cout << "New Array: ";
    for (i = 0; i < Num; i++)
        cout << T[i] << " ";
}
```

**Solution:** Save the first element in `C`, shift all elements one position to the left, then place `C` at the last position.

### Q3(b) — 3 Marks

An array `P[15][10]` is stored along the **column** in the memory with each element requiring **4 bytes** of storage. If the base address of array P is **14000**, find out the location of `P[8][5]`.

**Answer:**

Given:
- $L_r = 0$, $L_c = 0$ (lower bounds)
- Base address $= 14000$
- $W = 4$ bytes
- $R = 15$ (rows), $C = 10$ (columns)

**Column-major order formula:**

$$\text{Address}(i,j) = \text{Base} + W \times \big[(i - L_r) + R \times (j - L_c)\big]$$

$$\text{Address}(8,5) = 14000 + 4 \times \big[(8 - 0) + 15 \times (5 - 0)\big]$$

$$= 14000 + 4 \times [8 + 75]$$

$$= 14000 + 4 \times 83$$

$$= 14000 + 332$$

$$= \boxed{14332}$$

### Q3(c) — 2 Marks

Write a user-defined function `DispNTen(int L[][4], int R, int C)` in C++ to find and display all the numbers which are **not divisible by 10**.

For example, if the content of array is:

| 20 | 17 | 30 |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | 19 | 10 |

The output should be: `17  12  19`

**Answer:**

```cpp
void DispNTen(int L[][4], int R, int C)
{
    cout << "Elements in array not divisible by 10: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < R; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < C; j++)
            if (L[i][j] % 10 != 0)
                cout << L[i][j] << " ";
}
```

> **Note:** The original answer in the document incorrectly used `== 0` (which prints multiples of 10). The corrected condition is `!= 0` to display numbers **not** divisible by 10.

---

### Q3(d) — 2 Marks

Evaluate the following postfix expression. Show the status of the stack after execution of each operation:

$$60,\ 6,\ /,\ 5,\ 2,\ *,\ 5,\ -,\ +$$

**Answer:**

| Input Token | Operation | Stack Status |
|---|---|---|
| 60 | Push 60 | 60 |
| 6 | Push 6 | 60, 6 |
| `/` | Pop 6 and 60; compute $60 \div 6 = 10$; Push 10 | 10 |
| 5 | Push 5 | 10, 5 |
| 2 | Push 2 | 10, 5, 2 |
| `*` | Pop 2 and 5; compute $5 \times 2 = 10$; Push 10 | 10, 10 |
| 5 | Push 5 | 10, 10, 5 |
| `-` | Pop 5 and 10; compute $10 - 5 = 5$; Push 5 | 10, 5 |
| `+` | Pop 5 and 10; compute $10 + 5 = 15$; Push 15 | 15 |

**Final Result = 15**

### Q3(e) — 4 Marks

Write a function `QINSERT()` in C++ to perform **insert operation** on a Linked Queue, which contains Client No and Client Name. Consider the following definition of `NODE` in the code of `QINSERT()`.

```cpp
struct NODE
{
    long int Cno;     // Client No
    char Cname[20];   // Client Name
    NODE *Next;
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
// Assuming global pointers: NODE *f = NULL, *r = NULL;

void QINSERT()
{
    NODE *P = new NODE();

    cout << "Enter the Client Number: ";
    cin  >> P->Cno;

    cout << "Enter the Client Name: ";
    cin  >> P->Cname;

    P->Next = NULL;

    if (f == NULL && r == NULL)
    {
        f = r = P;       // Queue was empty
    }
    else
    {
        r->Next = P;     // Link new node at rear
        r = P;           // Update rear pointer
    }
}
```

### Q4(b) — 2 Marks

Write a function `CountHisHer()` in C++ which reads the contents of a text file `diary.txt` and counts the words **His** and **Her** (not case sensitive).

For example, if the file contains:
> Pinky has gone to his friend's house. His friends name is Ravya. Her house is 12 KM from here.

The function should display the output as:
```
Count for His : 2
Count for Her : 1
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void CountHisHer()
{
    ifstream f;
    f.open("diary.txt");

    char word[50];
    int his = 0, her = 0;

    while (f >> word)
    {
        // Convert word to uppercase for case-insensitive comparison
        for (int i = 0; word[i]; i++)
            word[i] = toupper(word[i]);

        if (strcmp(word, "HIS") == 0)
            his++;
        if (strcmp(word, "HER") == 0)
            her++;
    }

        cout << VDesc << endl;
        cout << Price << endl;
    }
    float ReturnPrice() { return Price; }
};
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void Show()
{
    VINTAGE Vin;
    ifstream f;
    f.open("VINTAGE.DAT", ios::binary);

    while (f.read((char*)&Vin, sizeof(Vin)))
    {
        if (Vin.ReturnPrice() >= 200000 && Vin.ReturnPrice() <= 250000)
            Vin.VIEW();
    }

    f.close();

## Section 6 — Boolean Algebra & Logic Circuits (Q6)

### Q6(a) — 2 Marks

Verify the following using Boolean Laws:

$$A + C = A + A'C + BC$$

**Answer / Proof (RHS → LHS):**

$$A + A'C + BC$$

$$= (A + A')(A + C) + BC \quad \text{(Distributive Law: } A + A'C = (A+A')(A+C)\text{)}$$

$$= 1 \cdot (A + C) + BC$$

$$= A + C + BC$$

$$= A + C(1 + B) \quad \text{(Factoring out } C\text{)}$$

$$= A + C \cdot 1 \quad \text{(since } 1 + B = 1\text{, OR Absorption Law)}$$

$$= A + C \quad \checkmark$$

### Q6(c) — 1 Mark

Write the **Sum of Product (SOP)** form of the function $G(X, Y, Z)$ for the following truth table:

| X | Y | Z | G |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

**Answer (Minterms where G = 1: rows 0, 2, 4, 7):**

$$G = (X'Y'Z') + (X'YZ') + (XY'Z') + (XYZ)$$

**Simplified:**

$$G = X'Z'(Y' + Y) + XY'Z' + XYZ$$

$$= X'Z' + XY'Z' + XYZ \quad \text{(Complement Law: } Y'+Y=1\text{)}$$

$$= Z'(X' + XY') + XYZ$$

$$= Z'(X' + Y') + XYZ \quad \text{(Redundancy/Absorption Law)}$$

$$\boxed{G = X'Z' + Y'Z' + XYZ}$$

### Q7(c) — 4 Marks

Expertia Professional Global (EPG) is an online corporate training provider company for IT-related courses. The company is setting up their new campus in Mumbai.

[Diagram: Physical Locations of the buildings of EPG — Three buildings shown: Faculty Studio Building (left), Finance Building (centre), Administrative Building (right).]

**Building to Building Distances:**

| From | To | Distance (m) |
|---|---|---|
| Administrative Building | Finance Building | 60 |
| Administrative Building | Faculty Studio Building | 120 |
| Finance Building | Faculty Studio Building | 70 |

**Expected Computers to be installed:**

| Building | Computers |
|---|---|
| Administrative Building | 20 |
| Finance Building | 40 |
| Faculty Studio Building | 120 |

---

**(i)** Suggest the most appropriate building where EPG should plan to install the server.

**Answer:** **Faculty Studio Building** — because it has the maximum number of computers (120), so placing the server there minimises network load and distance to the majority of clients.

---

**(ii)** Suggest the most appropriate building-to-building cable layout to connect all three buildings for efficient communication.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Recommended cable layout — Connect Faculty Studio Building ↔ Finance Building (70 m), and Finance Building ↔ Administrative Building (60 m). This forms a linear/star topology avoiding the longest cable run of 120 m directly from Faculty Studio to Administrative Building. Total cable used = 70 + 60 = 130 m.]

> The optimal layout is:
> **Faculty Studio Building → Finance Building** (70 m) **→ Administrative Building** (60 m)
> This uses the minimum total cable length of **130 m** vs. the alternative of 190 m.

---

**(iii)** Which type of network out of the following is formed by connecting the computers of these three buildings?

- LAN
- MAN
- WAN

**Answer:** **LAN (Local Area Network)** — since all three buildings are within the same campus/premises in close proximity.

---

**(iv)** Which wireless channel out of the following should be opted by EPG to connect to students from all over the world?

- Infrared
- Microwave Satellite

**Answer:** **Microwave Satellite** — because it supports global coverage and can connect users from all over the world, unlike Infrared which requires line-of-sight and works only over very short distances.

(iii) Getting into an unknown person's social networking account and starting to message on his behalf.

**Answer:** Both **(ii)** and **(iii)** are cybercrimes.

- **(ii)** Copying data without permission = **Unauthorized access / Data theft** (cybercrime).
- **(iii)** Hacking into someone's social network account = **Identity theft / Unauthorized access** (cybercrime).
- **(i)** Stealing a physical hard disk is a conventional theft, **not** a cybercrime.

> **Note:** The original answer key listed only (ii), but (iii) is also a cybercrime. Both should be credited.
