## Section A — 1 mark each

### Q1.
State True or False:

"Identifiers are names used to identify a variable, function in a program."

**Answer:** True

**Solution:** Identifiers are indeed the names used to identify variables, functions, and other entities in a program.

---

### Q2.
Which of the following is a valid keyword in Python?

(a) false
(b) return
(c) non_local
(d) none

**Answer:** (b) return

**Solution:** `return` is a valid Python keyword. Note that Python keywords are case-sensitive — `False` (capital F) is a keyword, but `false` (lowercase) is not. Similarly, `nonlocal` (without underscore) is a keyword, not `non_local`, and `None` (capital N) is a keyword, not `none`.

---

### Q3.
Given the following Tuple:

```python
Tup = (10, 20, 30, 50)
```

Which of the following statements will result in an error?

(a) `print(Tup[0])`
(b) `Tup.insert(2, 3)`
(c) `print(Tup[1:2])`
(d) `print(len(Tup))`

**Answer:** (b) `Tup.insert(2, 3)`

**Solution:** Tuples are immutable in Python, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. The `insert()` method is used to modify sequences, which is not allowed on tuples. This will raise an `AttributeError` since tuples do not have an `insert` method.

---

### Q4.
Consider the given expression:

```
5 < 10 and 12 > 7 or not 7 > 4
```

Which of the following will be the correct output, if the given expression is evaluated?

(a) True
(b) False
(c) NONE
(d) NULL

**Answer:** (a) True

**Solution:** Evaluating step by step using Python operator precedence (not > and > or):
- `5 < 10` → `True`
- `12 > 7` → `True`
- `7 > 4` → `True`, so `not 7 > 4` → `False`
- `True and True` → `True`
- `True or False` → `True`

---

### Q5.
Select the correct output of the code:

```python
S = "Amrit Mahostav @ 75"
A = S.partition(" ")
print(A)
```

(a) `('Amrit Mahostav', '@', '75')`
(b) `['Amrit', 'Mahostav', '@', '75']`
(c) `('Amrit', 'Mahostav @ 75')`
(d) `('Amrit', ' ', 'Mahostav @ 75')`

**Answer:** (d) `('Amrit', ' ', 'Mahostav @ 75')`

**Solution:** The `partition()` method splits the string at the **first occurrence** of the specified separator and returns a tuple of three parts: the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. Here the separator is a space `" "`, so the string is split into `('Amrit', ' ', 'Mahostav @ 75')`.

---

### Q6.
Which of the following mode keeps the file offset position at the end of the file?

(a) r+
(b) r
(c) w
(d) a

**Answer:** (d) a

**Solution:** The `'a'` (append) mode opens the file and places the file pointer at the end of the file, so any new data written is appended after the existing content.

---

### Q7.
Fill in the blank:

`________` function is used to arrange the elements of a list in ascending order.

(a) `sort()`
(b) `arrange()`
(c) `ascending()`
(d) `assort()`

**Answer:** (a) `sort()`

**Solution:** The `sort()` method in Python is used to sort the elements of a list in ascending order by default. For example, `list.sort()` arranges elements from smallest to largest.

---

### Q8.
Which of the following operators will return either True or False?

(a) `+=`
(b) `!=`
(c) `=`
(d) `*=`

**Answer:** (b) `!=`

**Solution:** The `!=` operator is a **comparison (relational) operator** that checks whether two values are not equal. It returns a Boolean value — either `True` or `False`. The others (`+=`, `=`, `*=`) are assignment operators and do not return Boolean values.

---

### Q9.
Which of the following statement(s) would give an error after executing the following code?

```python
Stud = {"Murugan": 100, "Mithu": 95}   # Statement 1
print(Stud[95])                          # Statement 2
Stud["Murugan"] = 99                     # Statement 3
print(Stud.pop())                        # Statement 4
print(Stud)                              # Statement 5
```

(a) Statement 2
(b) Statement 3
(c) Statement 4
(d) Statement 2 and 4

**Answer:** (d) Statement 2 and 4

**Solution:**
- **Statement 2** gives a `KeyError` because `95` is a **value**, not a **key** in the dictionary. Dictionary access must use keys.
- **Statement 4** gives a `TypeError` because `dict.pop()` requires at least one argument (the key to be removed) when used without a default value.
- Statement 3 is valid — it simply updates the value for the existing key `"Murugan"`.

---

### Q10.
Fill in the blank:

`______` is a number of tuples in a relation.

(a) Attribute
(b) Degree
(c) Domain
(d) Cardinality

**Answer:** (d) Cardinality

**Solution:** In relational database terminology:
- **Cardinality** = number of rows (tuples) in a relation
- **Degree** = number of columns (attributes) in a relation
- **Attribute** = a single column/field
- **Domain** = the set of permissible values for an attribute

---

### Q11.
The syntax of `seek()` is:

```python
file_object.seek(offset[, reference_point])
```

What is the default value of `reference_point`?

(a) 0
(b) 1
(c) 2
(d) 3

**Answer:** (a) 0

**Solution:** The default value of `reference_point` in `seek()` is `0`, which means the offset is measured from the **beginning of the file**. The possible values are:
- `0` → beginning of the file (default)
- `1` → current file position
- `2` → end of the file

---

### Q12.
Fill in the blank:

`______` clause is used with SELECT statement to display data in a sorted form with respect to a specified column.

(a) WHERE
(b) ORDER BY
(c) HAVING
(d) DISTINCT

**Answer:** (b) ORDER BY

**Solution:** The `ORDER BY` clause is used in SQL with the `SELECT` statement to sort the result set in either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order based on one or more columns.

---

### Q13.
Fill in the blank:

`______` is used for point-to-point communication or unicast communication such as radar and satellite.

(a) INFRARED WAVES
(b) BLUETOOTH
(c) MICROWAVES
(d) RADIOWAVES

**Answer:** (c) MICROWAVES

**Solution:** Microwaves are used for point-to-point (unicast) communication over long distances. They are used in radar systems, satellite communication, and microwave links. Unlike radio waves, microwaves travel in a straight line and are focused into a narrow beam, making them ideal for unicast communication.

---

### Q14.
What will the following expression be evaluated to in Python?

```python
print(4 + 3 * 5 / 3 - 5 % 2)
```

(a) 8.5
(b) 8.0
(c) 10.2
(d) 10.0

**Answer:** (b) 8.0

**Solution:** Applying Python operator precedence (BODMAS — `*`, `/`, `%` before `+`, `-`):

$$4 + 3 \times 5 / 3 - 5 \% 2$$

- $3 \times 5 = 15$
- $15 / 3 = 5.0$ (true division in Python 3)
- $5 \% 2 = 1$
- $4 + 5.0 - 1 = 8.0$

---

### Q15.
Which function returns the sum of all elements of a list?

(a) `count()`
(b) `sum()`
(c) `total()`
(d) `add()`

**Answer:** (b) `sum()`

**Solution:** The built-in `sum()` function in Python takes an iterable (like a list) as argument and returns the total sum of all its elements. For example, `sum([1, 2, 3])` returns `6`.

---

### Q16.
`fetchall()` method fetches all rows in a result set and returns a:

(a) Tuple of lists
(b) List of tuples
(c) List of strings
(d) Tuple of strings

**Answer:** (b) List of tuples

**Solution:** The `fetchall()` method in Python's database connectivity (e.g., `mysql.connector`) retrieves all the rows from the result of a query and returns them as a **list of tuples**, where each tuple represents one row of data.

---

### Q17. *(Assertion & Reasoning)*

**Assertion (A):** To use a function from a particular module, we need to import the module.

**Reason (R):** `import` statement can be written anywhere in the program, before using a function from that module.

(a) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation for (A).
(b) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is not the correct explanation for (A).
(c) (A) is true but (R) is false.
(d) (A) is false but (R) is true.

**Answer:** (b) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is not the correct explanation for (A).

**Solution:** The Assertion is true — you must import a module before using its functions. The Reason is also technically true — the `import` statement can appear anywhere in the code as long as it comes before the function call. However, the Reason does not correctly explain why we need to import the module; it only describes where the import can be placed. Hence (b) is correct.

---

### Q18. *(Assertion & Reasoning)*

**Assertion (A):** A stack is a LIFO structure.

**Reason (R):** Any new element pushed into the stack always gets positioned at the index after the last existing element in the stack.

(a) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation for (A).
(b) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is not the correct explanation for (A).
(c) (A) is true but (R) is false.
(d) (A) is false but (R) is true.

**Answer:** (c) (A) is true but (R) is false.

**Solution:** The Assertion is **true** — a stack follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle. The Reason is **false** — while a new element is appended at the end of the list (which acts as the top of the stack), the LIFO nature means the **last inserted element is the first to be removed**, not simply a matter of positional indexing. The reason incorrectly describes the mechanism and does not capture the LIFO characteristic.

## Section B — 2 marks each

### Q19.
Atharva is a Python programmer working on a program to find and return the maximum value from the list. The code written below has syntactical errors. Rewrite the correct code and underline the corrections made.

```python
def max_num(L):
max = L(0)
for a in L:
 if a > max
 max = a
return max
```

**Answer:**

```python
def max_num(L):
    max_value = L[0]           # Correction 1: L(0) → L[0] (square brackets for indexing)
    for a in L:
        if a > max_value:      # Correction 2: missing colon (:) added; max → max_value
            max_value = a      # Correction 3: max → max_value (max is a built-in, avoid overriding)
    return max_value           # Correction 4: max → max_value
```

**Solution:** The corrections made are:
1. `L(0)` → `L[0]` — Lists are indexed using square brackets `[]`, not parentheses `()`
2. `if a > max` → `if a > max_value:` — A colon `:` is required at the end of the `if` statement
3. `max` is renamed to `max_value` to avoid shadowing Python's built-in `max()` function (good practice)
4. Proper indentation is added throughout the function body

### Q20.

**(a)** Differentiate between wired and wireless transmission.

**OR**

**(b)** Differentiate between URL and domain name with the help of an appropriate example.

**Answer (a):**

| S.No. | Wired Transmission | Wireless Transmission |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1. | Uses physical cables (e.g., Ethernet, fibre optic) | Uses radio waves, microwaves, or infrared signals |
| 2. | Requires physical installation of cables | No physical cables required; uses airwaves |
| 3. | Generally faster and more stable | Can be slower and less stable |
| 4. | Less prone to interference | More prone to interference from other devices |
| 5. | Limited mobility due to physical cables | Allows greater mobility and flexibility |

---

**Answer (b):**

| S.No. | URL | Domain Name |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| 1. | A URL is the **complete address** used to access a specific resource on the internet | A domain name is the **unique name** that identifies a website on the internet |
| 2. | Includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the resource | Is only the name part of the URL |
| 3. | Directly accesses a specific page or resource | Used to find and identify the website |
| 4. | Format: `protocol://domain/path` | Format: `domainname.extension` |
| 5. | Example: `https://www.vedantu.com/page` | Example: `vedantu.com` |

---

### Q21.

**(a)** Given is a Python list declaration:

```python
Listofnames = ["Aman", "Ankit", "Ashish", "Rajan", "Rajat"]
```

Write the output of:

```python
print(Listofnames[-1:-4:-1])
```

**(b)** Consider the following tuple declaration:

```python
Tupl = (10, 20, 30, (10, 20, 30), 40)
```

Write the output of:

```python
print(Tupl.index(20))
```

**Answer (a):** `['Rajat', 'Rajan', 'Ashish']`

**Solution (a):** The slice `[-1:-4:-1]` starts at index `-1` (which is `'Rajat'`), stops before index `-4` (which is `'Ankit'`), and steps by `-1` (moving backwards). So it picks elements at indices `-1`, `-2`, `-3` → `'Rajat'`, `'Rajan'`, `'Ashish'`.

---

**Answer (b):** `1`

**Solution (b):** The `index()` method returns the index of the **first occurrence** of the specified value in the tuple. In `Tupl = (10, 20, 30, (10, 20, 30), 40)`, the value `20` first appears at index `1`. Note that `20` inside the nested tuple `(10, 20, 30)` is not directly an element of the outer tuple.

---

### Q22.
Explain the concept of "Alternate Key" in a Relational Database Management System with an appropriate example.

**Answer:**

**Alternate Key** in an RDBMS is a **candidate key that is not selected as the primary key**. It can uniquely identify each record in a table but serves as an alternative to the primary key.

- **Candidate Key:** Any column (or combination of columns) that can uniquely identify each row.
- **Primary Key:** The candidate key chosen to be the main unique identifier.
- **Alternate Key:** All remaining candidate keys that were not chosen as the primary key.

**Example:**

Consider a table `Students`:

| StudentID | Email | PhoneNumber |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 101 | john@example.com | 123-456-7890 |
| 102 | jane@example.com | 234-567-8901 |
| 103 | doe@example.com | 345-678-9012 |

- **Primary Key:** `StudentID` (chosen as the main identifier)
- **Alternate Keys:** `Email` and `PhoneNumber` — both can uniquely identify a student but are not selected as the primary key.

---

### Q23.

**(a)** Write the full forms of the following:

(i) HTML
(ii) TCP

**(b)** What is the need of Protocols?

**Answer (a):**

(i) **HTML** — Hypertext Markup Language

(ii) **TCP** — Transmission Control Protocol

---

**Answer (b):**

Protocols are essential in networking and communication because they define standardised rules and conventions for data transmission. The need for protocols includes:

1. **Consistency:** Ensure different devices communicate in a uniform and predictable manner.
2. **Compatibility:** Allow hardware and software from different manufacturers to work together seamlessly.
3. **Error Handling:** Provide mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors during data transmission.
4. **Efficiency:** Define how data is formatted and sent, making communication more efficient and reliable.
5. **Security:** Some protocols include encryption methods to protect data from unauthorised access.

---

### Q24.

**(a)** Write the output of the code given below:

```python
def short_sub(lst, n):
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(lst) > 4:
            lst[i] = lst[i] + lst[i]
        else:
            lst[i] = lst[i]

subject = ['CS', 'HINDI', 'PHYSICS', 'CHEMISTRY', 'MATHS']
short_sub(subject, 5)
print(subject)
```

**OR**

**(b)** Write the output of the code given below:

```python
a = 30
def call(x):
    global a
    if a % 2 == 0:
        x += a
    else:
        x -= a
    return x

x = 20
print(call(35), end="#")
print(call(40), end="@")
```

**Answer (a):**

```
['CSCS', 'HINDIHINDI', 'PHYSICSPHYSICS', 'CHEMISTRYCHEMISTRY', 'MATHSMATHS']
```

**Solution (a):**
- The list `subject` has 5 elements, so `len(lst) = 5 > 4` is `True` throughout.
- For each element at index `i`, `lst[i] = lst[i] + lst[i]` doubles (concatenates) the string.
- `'CS'` → `'CSCS'`
- `'HINDI'` → `'HINDIHINDI'`
- `'PHYSICS'` → `'PHYSICSPHYSICS'`
- `'CHEMISTRY'` → `'CHEMISTRYCHEMISTRY'`
- `'MATHS'` → `'MATHSMATHS'`

---

**Answer (b):**

```
65#70@
```

**Solution (b):**
- `a = 30` (global variable); `30 % 2 == 0` is `True`, so the function always executes `x += a`.
- First call `call(35)`: `x = 35 + 30 = 65` → prints `65#`
- Second call `call(40)`: `x = 40 + 30 = 70` → prints `70@`
- Final output: `65#70@`

---

### Q25.

**(a)** Differentiate between CHAR and VARCHAR data types in SQL with appropriate example.

**OR**

**(b)** Name any two DDL and any two DML commands.

**Answer (a):**

| CHAR | VARCHAR |
|------|---------|
| Fixed-length data type | Variable-length data type |
| Uses the same amount of storage regardless of actual data length | Uses only as much storage as needed for the actual data |
| Pads unused space with blank spaces up to the defined length | Does not pad unused space |
| Faster for fixed-size data (no length check needed) | More storage-efficient for variable-size data |
| Example: `CHAR(10)` storing `"Hello"` stores it as `"Hello     "` (5 trailing spaces) | Example: `VARCHAR(10)` storing `"Hello"` stores it as `"Hello"` (exactly 5 characters) |

---

**Answer (b):**

**DDL (Data Definition Language) Commands:**

1. `CREATE` — Used to create a new table, database, or other database objects.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));
   ```

2. `ALTER` — Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Students ADD Age INT;
   ```

**DML (Data Manipulation Language) Commands:**

1. `INSERT` — Used to add new records into a table.
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'John', 20);
   ```

2. `UPDATE` — Used to modify existing records in a table.
   ```sql
   UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE ID = 1;
   ```

## Section C — 3–4 marks each

### Q26.

**(a)** Consider the following tables — LOAN and BORROWER:

**Table: LOAN**

| LOAN_NO | B_NAME | AMOUNT |
|---------|--------|--------|
| L-170 | DELHI | 3000 |
| L-230 | KANPUR | 4000 |

**Table: BORROWER**

| CUST_NAME | LOAN_NO |
|-----------|---------|
| JOHN | L-171 |
| KRISH | L-230 |
| RAVYA | L-170 |

How many rows and columns will be there in the natural join of these two tables?

**(b)** Write the output of the queries (i) to (iv) based on the table WORKER given below:

**TABLE: WORKER**

| W_ID | F_NAME | L_NAME | CITY | STATE |
|------|--------|--------|------|-------|
| 102 | SAHIL | KHAN | KANPUR | UTTAR PRADESH |
| 104 | SAMEER | PARIKH | ROOP NAGAR | PUNJAB |
| 105 | MARY | JONES | DELHI | DELHI |
| 106 | MAHIR | SHARMA | SONIPAT | HARYANA |
| 107 | ATHARVA | BHARDAWAJ | DELHI | DELHI |
| 108 | VEDA | SHARMA | KANPUR | UTTAR PRADESH |

(i) `SELECT F_NAME, CITY FROM WORKER ORDER BY STATE DESC;`

(ii) `SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM WORKER;`

(iii) `SELECT F_NAME, STATE FROM WORKER WHERE L_NAME LIKE '_HA%';`

(iv) `SELECT CITY, COUNT(*) FROM WORKER GROUP BY CITY;`

**Answer (a):**

A natural join combines rows from both tables where the `LOAN_NO` values match.

**Result of Natural Join:**

| LOAN_NO | B_NAME | AMOUNT | CUST_NAME |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| L-170 | DELHI | 3000 | RAVYA |
| L-230 | KANPUR | 4000 | KRISH |

- **Number of Rows:** 2 (only L-170 and L-230 have matching entries in both tables; L-171 exists only in BORROWER)
- **Number of Columns:** 4 (LOAN_NO, B_NAME, AMOUNT, CUST_NAME)

---

**Answer (b)(i):**

States in descending alphabetical order: UTTAR PRADESH > PUNJAB > HARYANA > DELHI > DELHI

| F_NAME | CITY |
|--------|------|
| SAHIL | KANPUR |
| VEDA | KANPUR |
| SAMEER | ROOP NAGAR |
| MAHIR | SONIPAT |
| MARY | DELHI |
| ATHARVA | DELHI |

---

**Answer (b)(ii):**

| CITY |
|------|
| KANPUR |
| ROOP NAGAR |
| DELHI |
| SONIPAT |

**Solution:** `DISTINCT` removes duplicate city values. KANPUR and DELHI each appear twice but are shown only once.

---

**Answer (b)(iii):**

The pattern `'_HA%'` matches last names where:
- `_` = any single character
- `HA` = literal characters
- `%` = any sequence of characters

Matching L_NAMEs: `KHAN` (K-H-A-N ✓), `SHARMA` (S-H-A-R-M-A ✓), `SHARMA` again ✓

| F_NAME | STATE |
|--------|-------|
| SAHIL | UTTAR PRADESH |
| MAHIR | HARYANA |
| VEDA | UTTAR PRADESH |

---

**Answer (b)(iv):**

| CITY | COUNT(*) |
|------|----------|
| KANPUR | 2 |
| ROOP NAGAR | 1 |
| DELHI | 2 |
| SONIPAT | 1 |

---

### Q27.

**(a)** Write the definition of a Python function named `LongLines()` which reads the contents of a text file named `'LINES.TXT'` and displays those lines which have at least 10 words in it.

For example, if the content of `'LINES.TXT'` is:
```
Once upon a times, there was a woodcutter
He lived in a little house in a beautiful, green wood.
One day, he was merrily chopping some wood.
He saw a little girl skipping through the woods, whistling happily.
The girl was followed by a big gray wolf.
```

Then the function should display output as:
```
He lived in a little house in a beautiful, green wood.
He saw a little girl skipping through the woods, whistling happily.
```

**OR**

**(b)** Write a function `COUNT_DWORDS()` in Python to count the words ending with a digit in a text file `"Details.txt"`.

Example — If the file content is:
```
On seat2 VIP1 will sit and
On seat 1 VIP2 will be sitting
```
Output will be:
```
Number of words ending with a digit are 4
```

**Answer (a):**

```python
def LongLines():
    with open('LINES.TXT', 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if len(line.split()) >= 10:
                print(line.strip())

LongLines()
```

**Solution:**
1. **Open the File:** `'LINES.TXT'` is opened in read mode using a `with` statement (auto-closes the file).
2. **Loop Through Lines:** Each line is iterated.
3. **Split into Words:** `line.split()` splits the line by whitespace into a list of words.
4. **Check Word Count:** If the number of words is 10 or more, the line is printed (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace using `strip()`).

---

**Answer (b):**

```python
def COUNT_DWORDS():
    count = 0
    with open('Details.txt', 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = line.split()
            for word in words:
                if word[-1].isdigit():
                    count += 1
    print("Number of words ending with a digit are", count)

COUNT_DWORDS()
```

**Solution:** For each word in the file, we check whether its last character (`word[-1]`) is a digit using `isdigit()`. If so, the counter is incremented. For the given example, `seat2`, `VIP1`, `VIP2`, and `1` all end with digits, giving a count of 4.

---

### Q28.

**(a)** Write the outputs of the SQL queries (i) to (iv) based on the relations COMPUTER and SALES given below:

**Table: COMPUTER**

| PROD_ID | PROD_NAME | PRICE | COMPANY | TYPE |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|------|
| P001 | MOUSE | 200 | LOGITECH | INPUT |
| P002 | LASER PRINTER | 4000 | CANON | OUTPUT |
| P003 | KEYBOARD | 500 | LOGITECH | INPUT |
| P004 | JOYSTICK | 1000 | IBALL | INPUT |
| P005 | SPEAKER | 1200 | CREATIVE | OUTPUT |
| P006 | DESKJET PRINTER | 4300 | CANON | OUTPUT |

**Table: SALES**

| PROD_ID | QTY_SOLD | QUARTER |
|---------|----------|---------|
| P002 | 4 | 1 |
| P003 | 2 | 2 |
| P001 | 3 | 2 |
| P004 | 2 | 1 |

(i) `SELECT MIN(PRICE), MAX(PRICE) FROM COMPUTER;`

(ii) `SELECT COMPANY, COUNT(*) FROM COMPUTER GROUP BY COMPANY HAVING COUNT(COMPANY) > 1;`

(iii) `SELECT PROD_NAME, QTY_SOLD FROM COMPUTER C, SALES S WHERE C.PROD_ID = S.PROD_ID AND TYPE = 'INPUT';`

(iv) `SELECT PROD_NAME, COMPANY, QUARTER FROM COMPUTER C, SALES S WHERE C.PROD_ID = S.PROD_ID;`

**(b)** Write the command to view all databases.

**Answer (a)(i):**

| MIN(PRICE) | MAX(PRICE) |
|------------|------------|
| 200 | 4300 |

---

**Answer (a)(ii):**

| COMPANY | COUNT(*) |
|---------|----------|
| LOGITECH | 2 |
| CANON | 2 |

**Solution:** IBALL and CREATIVE each have only 1 product, so they are excluded by the `HAVING COUNT(COMPANY) > 1` condition.

---

**Answer (a)(iii):**

Joining COMPUTER and SALES on PROD_ID, then filtering for TYPE = 'INPUT':
- P001 (MOUSE, INPUT) — sold 3
- P003 (KEYBOARD, INPUT) — sold 2
- P004 (JOYSTICK, INPUT) — sold 2

| PROD_NAME | QTY_SOLD |
|-----------|----------|
| MOUSE | 3 |
| KEYBOARD | 2 |
| JOYSTICK | 2 |

---

**Answer (a)(iv):**

Joining both tables on PROD_ID (all matching records):

| PROD_NAME | COMPANY | QUARTER |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| LASER PRINTER | CANON | 1 |
| KEYBOARD | LOGITECH | 2 |
| MOUSE | LOGITECH | 2 |
| JOYSTICK | IBALL | 1 |

### Q29.
Write a function `EOReplace()` in Python, which accepts a list `L` of numbers. Thereafter, it increments all even numbers by 1 and decrements all odd numbers by 1.

Example:
- Sample Input: `L = [10, 20, 30, 40, 35, 55]`
- Output: `L = [11, 21, 31, 41, 34, 54]`

**Answer:**

```python
def EOReplace(L):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] % 2 == 0:
            L[i] += 1    # Increment even numbers by 1
        else:
            L[i] -= 1    # Decrement odd numbers by 1
    return L

# Example usage
L = [10, 20, 30, 40, 35, 55]
print(EOReplace(L))   # Output: [11, 21, 31, 41, 34, 54]
```

**Solution:**
1. **Loop through the list** using index `i`.
2. **Check even or odd:** If `L[i] % 2 == 0`, the number is even → increment by 1. Otherwise, it is odd → decrement by 1.
3. **Return the modified list.**

Verification:
- `10` (even) → `11`
- `20` (even) → `21`
- `30` (even) → `31`
- `40` (even) → `41`
- `35` (odd) → `34`
- `55` (odd) → `54`

### Q30.

**(a)** A list contains the following record of a customer:

`[Customer_name, Room Type]`

Write the following user defined functions to perform given operations on the stack named `'Hotel'`:

(i) `Push_Cust()` — To push customers' names of those customers who are staying in `'Delux'` Room Type.

(ii) `Pop_Cust()` — To pop the names of customers from the stack and display them. Also, display `"Underflow"` when there are no customers in the stack.

For Example — If the lists with customer details are:
```
["Siddarth", "Delux"]
["Rahul", "Standard"]
["Jerry", "Delux"]
```
The stack should contain:
```
Jerry
Siddarth
```
The output should be:
```
Jerry
Siddarth
Underflow
```

**OR**

**(b)** Write a function in Python, `Push(Vehicle)` where `Vehicle` is a dictionary containing details of vehicles — `{Car_Name: Maker}`. The function should push the name of cars manufactured by `"TATA"` (including all possible cases like Tata, TaTa, etc.) to the stack.

For Example — If the dictionary contains:
```python
Vehicle = {"Santro": "Hyundai", "Nexon": "TATA", "Safari": "Tata"}
```
The stack should contain:
```
Safari
Nexon
```

**Answer (a):**

```python
Hotel = []

def Push_Cust(customers):
    for customer in customers:
        if customer[1] == "Delux":
            Hotel.append(customer[0])

def Pop_Cust():
    if Hotel:
        print(Hotel.pop())
    else:
        print("Underflow")

# Example usage
customers = [["Siddarth", "Delux"], ["Rahul", "Standard"], ["Jerry", "Delux"]]
Push_Cust(customers)

# Pop and display all customers
while Hotel:
    Pop_Cust()

# Attempt to pop from an empty stack
Pop_Cust()
```

**Output:**
```
Jerry
Siddarth
Underflow
```

**Solution:**
1. `Hotel` is an empty list used as a stack.
2. `Push_Cust()` iterates through the customer list and appends names of customers with room type `"Delux"` — so `"Siddarth"` and `"Jerry"` are pushed (in that order).
3. `Pop_Cust()` uses `list.pop()` which removes and returns the **last element** (LIFO). So `"Jerry"` is popped first, then `"Siddarth"`.
4. A subsequent call on an empty stack prints `"Underflow"`.

---

**Answer (b):**

```python
def Push(Vehicle):
    stack = []
    for car_name, maker in Vehicle.items():
        if maker.lower() == "tata":
            stack.append(car_name)
    return stack

# Example usage
Vehicle = {"Santro": "Hyundai", "Nexon": "TATA", "Safari": "Tata"}
stack = Push(Vehicle)
print(stack)   # Output: ['Nexon', 'Safari']
```

**Solution:**
1. An empty list `stack` is used as the stack.
2. For each car in the dictionary, `maker.lower() == "tata"` converts the maker name to lowercase before comparing, handling all cases like `"TATA"`, `"Tata"`, `"TaTa"`, etc.
3. Matching car names are appended to the stack.
4. The stack contains `['Nexon', 'Safari']` (in insertion order based on dictionary iteration).

## Section D — 5 marks each

### Q31.
Quickdev, an IT based firm located in Delhi, is planning to set up a network for its four branches within a city with its Marketing department in Kanpur. As a network professional, give solutions to the questions (i) to (v), after going through the branch locations and other details given below:

[Diagram: Delhi Branch contains Branch A, Branch B, Branch C, Branch D. Kanpur Branch contains Marketing Dept.]

**Distance between various branches:**

| Branch | Distance |
|--------|----------|
| Branch A to Branch B | 40 m |
| Branch A to Branch C | 80 m |
| Branch A to Branch D | 65 m |
| Branch B to Branch C | 30 m |
| Branch B to Branch D | 35 m |
| Branch C to Branch D | 15 m |
| Delhi Branch to Kanpur | 300 km |

**Number of computers in each branch:**

| Branch | Number of Computers |
|--------|-------------------|
| Branch A | 15 |
| Branch B | 25 |
| Branch C | 40 |
| Branch D | 115 |

(i) Suggest the most suitable place to install the server for the Delhi branch with a suitable reason.

(ii) Suggest an ideal layout for connecting all these branches within Delhi.

(iii) Which device will you suggest that should be placed in each of these branches to efficiently connect all the computers within these branches?

(iv) Delhi firm is planning to connect to its Marketing department in Kanpur which is approximately 300 km away. Which type of network out of LAN, WAN or MAN will be formed? Justify your answer.

(v) Suggest a protocol that shall be needed to provide help for transferring files between Delhi and Kanpur branch.

---

**Answer (i):**

**Suggestion:** The most suitable place to install the server is **Branch D**.

**Reason:** Branch D has the highest number of computers (115). Placing the server at Branch D minimises network congestion and provides better performance, as the majority of users are located there, reducing the data travel distance for most requests.

---

**Answer (ii):**

**Suggestion:** **Star Topology** is ideal for connecting all branches within Delhi.

**Explanation:**
- Place a central hub/switch at Branch D (which also hosts the server).
- Connect Branches A, B, and C directly to Branch D.
- This minimises maximum distance between branches and provides a centralised point for network management and troubleshooting.

---

**Answer (iii):**

**Suggestion:** Use **Switches** in each branch.

**Explanation:** Switches efficiently connect multiple computers within a local network. Unlike hubs, switches direct data only to the specific intended recipient (using MAC addresses), thereby reducing unnecessary network traffic and increasing overall network efficiency.

---

**Answer (iv):**

**Network Type:** **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

**Justification:** The distance between Delhi and Kanpur is approximately 300 km. This far exceeds the typical coverage of:
- **LAN** (Local Area Network) — limited to a building or campus
- **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) — covers a city or metropolitan area (typically up to ~50 km)

A **WAN** is designed for long-distance communications connecting geographically dispersed locations, making it the appropriate choice here.

---

**Answer (v):**

**Suggested Protocol:** **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

**Explanation:** FTP is a standard network protocol specifically designed for transferring files between a client and a server over a computer network. It provides a reliable and efficient mechanism for moving large amounts of data between the Delhi and Kanpur branches.

### Q32.

**(a)** What possible output(s) are expected to be displayed on screen at the time of execution of the following program?

```python
import random
M = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
for i in range(1, 3):
    first = random.randint(2, 5) - 1
    sec = random.randint(3, 6) - 2
    third = random.randint(1, 4)
    print(M[first], M[sec], M[third], sep="#")
```

(i) `10#25#15`
    `20#25#25`

(ii) `5#25#20`
     `25#20#15`

(iii) `30#20#20`
      `20#25#25`

(iv) `10#15#25#`
     `15#20#10#`

**(b)** The code given below deletes the record from the table `employee` which contains the following record structure:
- E_code – String
- E_name – String
- Sal – Integer
- City – String

*(Note: Username is root, Password is root, database name is emp)*

Write the following statements to complete the code:
- **Statement 1** — to import the desired library.
- **Statement 2** — to execute the command that deletes the record with E_code as `'E101'`.
- **Statement 3** — to delete the record permanently from the database.

```python
import ___________ as mysql       # Statement 1
def delete():
    mydb = mysql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", passwd="root", database="emp")
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    ___________                    # Statement 2
    ___________                    # Statement 3
    print("Record deleted")
```

**OR**

**(a)** Predict the output of the code given below:

```python
def makenew(mystr):
    newstr = " "
    count = 0
    for i in mystr:
        if count % 2 != 0:
            newstr = newstr + str(count)
        else:
            if i.lower():
                newstr = newstr + i.upper()
            else:
                newstr = newstr + i
        count += 1
    print(newstr)

makenew("No@1")
```

**(b)** The code given below reads records from the table `employee` and displays only those records of employees coming from city `'Delhi'`.

Write the following statements to complete the code:
- **Statement 1** — to import the desired library.
- **Statement 2** — to execute the query that fetches records of employees from city `'Delhi'`.
- **Statement 3** — to read the complete data into the object named `details`.

```python
import ______________ as mysql     # Statement 1
def display():
    mydb = mysql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", passwd="root", database="emp")
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    ______________________________  # Statement 2
    Details = ____________________  # Statement 3
    for i in details:
        print(i)
```

**Answer (a) — Random output analysis:**

The ranges for each variable are:
- `first = random.randint(2,5) - 1` → values: 1, 2, 3, or 4 → `M[first]` can be: 10, 15, 20, or 25
- `sec = random.randint(3,6) - 2` → values: 1, 2, 3, or 4 → `M[sec]` can be: 10, 15, 20, or 25
- `third = random.randint(1,4)` → values: 1, 2, 3, or 4 → `M[third]` can be: 10, 15, 20, or 25

The loop runs **twice** (for `i = 1` and `i = 2`), producing two lines of output.

Possible values for each element: 10, 15, 20, 25.

**Answer:** Option **(iii) is the possible output:**
```
30#20#20
20#25#25
```

Wait — `30` would require index `5`, and `first` can only be 1–4. Correcting: Option **(i) is a valid possible output:**
```
10#25#15
20#25#25
```
Here `M[1]=10`, `M[4]=25`, `M[3]=20`... Checking all options against valid index ranges (1–4):
- Option (i): `10#25#15` → indices 1, 4, 3 ✓ and `20#25#25` → indices 3, 4, 4 ✓ → **Valid**
- Option (iii): `30` = `M[5]` — index 5 is out of range for `first` and `sec` → **Invalid**

**Answer:** **(i)**

---

**Answer (b) — Delete record:**

```python
import mysql.connector as mysql    # Statement 1

def delete():
    mydb = mysql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", passwd="root", database="emp")
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    mycursor.execute("DELETE FROM employee WHERE E_code = 'E101'")   # Statement 2
    mydb.commit()                                                     # Statement 3
    print("Record deleted")
```

**Solution:**
- **Statement 1:** `mysql.connector` is the Python library for MySQL connectivity.
- **Statement 2:** `mycursor.execute()` runs the SQL `DELETE` command targeting the row where `E_code = 'E101'`.
- **Statement 3:** `mydb.commit()` permanently saves (commits) the deletion to the database. Without `commit()`, the change is not persisted.

---

**Answer (OR)(a) — Predict output of `makenew("No@1")`:**

Tracing through each character:

| count | i | count%2!=0? | Action | newstr |
|-------|---|-------------|--------|--------|
| 0 | `N` | False (even) | `i.lower()` = `'n'` (truthy) → add `i.upper()` = `'N'` | `" N"` |
| 1 | `o` | True (odd) | add `str(count)` = `'1'` | `" N1"` |
| 2 | `@` | False (even) | `'@'.lower()` = `'@'` (truthy, non-empty string) → add `'@'.upper()` = `'@'` | `" N1@"` |
| 3 | `1` | True (odd) | add `str(count)` = `'3'` | `" N1@3"` |

**Output:**
```
 N1@3
```
*(Note: there is a leading space because `newstr` was initialised as `" "`)*

---

**Answer (OR)(b) — Display Delhi employees:**

```python
import mysql.connector as mysql                                              # Statement 1

def display():
    mydb = mysql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", passwd="root", database="emp")
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employee WHERE City = 'Delhi'")         # Statement 2
    details = mycursor.fetchall()                                           # Statement 3
    for i in details:
        print(i)

display()
```

**Solution:**
- **Statement 1:** Import `mysql.connector` library.
- **Statement 2:** Execute the SQL `SELECT` query filtering rows where `City = 'Delhi'`.
- **Statement 3:** `fetchall()` retrieves all matching rows and stores them as a list of tuples in `details`.

### Q33.

**(a)** Write one difference between CSV and text files.

Write a program in Python that defines and calls the following user defined functions:

(i) `COURIER_ADD()` — Takes values from the user and adds the details to a CSV file `'courier.csv'`. Each record consists of a list with field elements as `cid, s_name, Source, destination` to store Courier ID, Sender name, Source and destination address respectively.

(ii) `COURIER_SEARCH()` — Takes the destination as the input and displays all the courier records going to that destination.

**OR**

**(b)** Why is it important to close a file before exiting?

Write a program in Python that defines and calls the following user defined functions:

(i) `Add_Book()` — Takes the details of the books and adds them to a CSV file `'Book.csv'`. Each record consists of a list with field elements as `book_ID, B_name, pub` to store book ID, book name and publisher respectively.

(ii) `Search_Book()` — Takes publisher name as input and counts and displays the number of books published by them.

---

**Answer (a) — Difference between CSV and text files:**

| CSV File | Text File |
|----------|-----------|
| Stores data in a structured format with values separated by commas (or other delimiters) | Stores data as plain text without a predefined structure |
| Ideal for tabular/structured data (like spreadsheets) | Can contain any type of textual data |

---

**Answer (a)(i) — `COURIER_ADD()`:**

```python
import csv

def COURIER_ADD():
    cid = input("Enter Courier ID: ")
    s_name = input("Enter Sender Name: ")
    source = input("Enter Source Address: ")
    destination = input("Enter Destination Address: ")
    
    record = [cid, s_name, source, destination]
    
    with open('courier.csv', mode='a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(record)
    
    print("Courier details added successfully!")

# Call the function
COURIER_ADD()
```

---

**Answer (a)(ii) — `COURIER_SEARCH()`:**

```python
import csv

def COURIER_SEARCH(destination):
    found = False
    with open('courier.csv', mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            if row[3] == destination:
                print(row)
                found = True
    if not found:
        print(f"No courier records found for destination: {destination}")

# Call the function
dest = input("Enter the destination to search for: ")
COURIER_SEARCH(dest)
```

---

**Answer (b) — Importance of closing a file:**

Closing a file before exiting a program is important because:
1. **Data integrity:** All buffered data is flushed and written to the file; without closing, some data may not be saved.
2. **Resource release:** The operating system has a limited number of file handles; closing frees system resources.
3. **Prevents file locking:** An open file may be locked, preventing other programs from accessing it.
4. **Avoids corruption:** Abruptly ending without closing may corrupt the file structure.

---

**Answer (b)(i) — `Add_Book()`:**

```python
import csv

def Add_Book():
    book_id = input("Enter Book ID: ")
    b_name = input("Enter Book Name: ")
    pub = input("Enter Publisher: ")
    
    record = [book_id, b_name, pub]
    
    with open('Book.csv', mode='a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(record)
    
    print("Book details added successfully.")

# Call the function
Add_Book()
```

---

**Answer (b)(ii) — `Search_Book()`:**

```python
import csv

def Search_Book(publisher_name):
    count = 0
    with open('Book.csv', mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            if row[2] == publisher_name:
                count += 1
    print(f"Number of books published by {publisher_name}: {count}")

# Call the function
pub_input = input("Enter the publisher name to search for: ")
Search_Book(pub_input)
```

## Section E — 4 marks each

### Q34.
The school has asked their estate manager Mr. Rahul to maintain the data of all the labs in a table LAB. Rahul has entered data of 5 labs:

| LABNO | LAB_NAME | INCHARGE | CAPACITY | FLOOR |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|-------|
| L001 | CHEMISTRY | Daisy | 20 | I |
| L002 | BIOLOGY | Venky | 20 | II |
| L003 | MATH | Preeti | 15 | I |
| L004 | LANGUAGE | Daisy | 36 | III |
| L005 | COMPUTER | Mary Kom | 37 | II |

Based on the data given above, answer the following questions:

(i) Identify the columns which can be considered as Candidate Keys.

(ii) Write the degree and cardinality of the table.

(iii) Write the statements to:
- (a) Insert a new row with appropriate data.
- (b) Increase the capacity of all the labs by 10 students which are on 'I' Floor.

**OR** *(Option for part (iii) only)*

(iii) Write the statements to:
- (a) Add a constraint PRIMARY KEY to the column LABNO in the table.
- (b) Delete the table LAB.

---

**Answer (i):**

A **Candidate Key** is a column (or set of columns) that can uniquely identify every row in the table.

Examining the data:
- **LABNO** — Each value is unique (L001, L002, L003, L004, L005) ✓
- **LAB_NAME** — Each lab name is unique ✓

Both `LABNO` and `LAB_NAME` can be considered **Candidate Keys**. `INCHARGE`, `CAPACITY`, and `FLOOR` have duplicate values, so they cannot serve as candidate keys alone.

**Candidate Keys: LABNO and LAB_NAME**

---

**Answer (ii):**

- **Degree** = number of **columns (attributes)** = **5** (LABNO, LAB_NAME, INCHARGE, CAPACITY, FLOOR)
- **Cardinality** = number of **rows (tuples)** = **5** (one row for each lab)

---

**Answer (iii)(a) — Insert a new row:**

```sql
INSERT INTO LAB (LABNO, LAB_NAME, INCHARGE, CAPACITY, FLOOR)
VALUES ('L006', 'PHYSICS', 'Ravi', 25, 'III');
```

**Answer (iii)(b) — Increase capacity of labs on Floor 'I' by 10:**

```sql
UPDATE LAB
SET CAPACITY = CAPACITY + 10
WHERE FLOOR = 'I';
```

**Solution:** After this update:
- L001 (CHEMISTRY, Floor I): CAPACITY = 20 + 10 = 30
- L003 (MATH, Floor I): CAPACITY = 15 + 10 = 25

---

**Answer (OR)(iii)(a) — Add PRIMARY KEY constraint to LABNO:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE LAB
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_LABNO PRIMARY KEY (LABNO);
```

**Answer (OR)(iii)(b) — Delete the table LAB:**

```sql
DROP TABLE LAB;
```

**Solution:** `DROP TABLE` permanently removes the entire table structure and all its data from the database. This is different from `DELETE`, which only removes rows but keeps the table structure.

---

### Q35.
Shreyas is a programmer who has been given a task to write a user defined function named `write_bin()` to create a binary file called `Cust_file.dat` containing customer information — customer number (`c_no`), name (`c_name`), quantity (`qty`), price (`price`) and amount (`amt`).

The function accepts customer number, name, quantity and price. It displays `'Quantity less than 10..... Cannot SAVE'` if quantity is less than 10. Otherwise, it calculates `amount = price * quantity` and writes the record as a list into the binary file.

```python
import pickle

def write_bin():
    bin_file = ______                # Statement 1
    while True:
        c_no = int(input("enter customer number"))
        c_name = input("enter customer name")
        qty = int(input("enter qty"))
        price = int(input("enter price"))
        if ________                  # Statement 2
            print("Quantity less than 10.. Cannot SAVE")
        else:
            amt = price * qty
            c_detail = [c_no, c_name, qty, price, amt]
            ______                   # Statement 3
            ans = input("Do you wish to enter more records y/n")
            if ans.lower() == 'n':
                ________             # Statement 4
                _______________      # Statement 5
_____________________                # Statement 6
```

(i) Write the correct statement to open a file `'Cust_file.dat'` for writing the data of the customer. *(Statement 1)*

(ii) Which statement should Shreyas fill in Statement 2 to check whether quantity is less than 10?

(iii) Which statement should Shreyas fill in Statement 3 to write data to the binary file and in Statement 4 to stop further processing if the user does not wish to enter more records?

**OR** *(Option for part (iii) only)*

(iii) What should Shreyas fill in Statement 5 to close the binary file named `Cust_file.dat` and in Statement 6 to call the function to write data in the binary file?

---

**Answer (i) — Statement 1:**

```python
bin_file = open('Cust_file.dat', 'wb')
```

**Solution:** The file is opened in `'wb'` mode — `'w'` for write and `'b'` for binary. This creates the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites it if it does.

**Answer (ii) — Statement 2:**

```python
if qty < 10:
```

**Solution:** This condition checks whether the entered quantity is less than 10 and triggers the warning message.

---

**Answer (iii) — Statement 3 and Statement 4:**

**Statement 3** — Write data to the binary file:
```python
pickle.dump(c_detail, bin_file)
```

**Statement 4** — Stop further processing (break out of the loop):
```python
break
```

**Solution:**
- `pickle.dump(object, file)` serialises the Python object `c_detail` and writes it to the binary file `bin_file`.
- `break` terminates the `while True` loop when the user enters `'n'`, stopping further data entry.

---

**Answer (OR)(iii) — Statement 5 and Statement 6:**

**Statement 5** — Close the binary file:
```python
bin_file.close()
```

**Statement 6** — Call the function to write data in the binary file:
```python
write_bin()
```

**Solution:**
- `bin_file.close()` closes the file, flushing all buffered data and releasing the file resource.
- `write_bin()` is the function call that initiates the entire data entry and file writing process.

def write_bin():
    bin_file = open('Cust_file.dat', 'wb')        # Statement 1
    while True:
        c_no = int(input("Enter customer number: "))
        c_name = input("Enter customer name: ")
        qty = int(input("Enter qty: "))
        price = int(input("Enter price: "))
        if qty < 10:                               # Statement 2
            print("Quantity less than 10.. Cannot SAVE")
        else:
            amt = price * qty
            c_detail = [c_no, c_name, qty, price, amt]
            pickle.dump(c_detail, bin_file)        # Statement 3
            ans = input("Do you wish to enter more records y/n: ")
            if ans.lower() == 'n':
                break                              # Statement 4
    bin_file.close()                               # Statement 5

write_bin()                                        # Statement 6
```
