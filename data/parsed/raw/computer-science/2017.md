Anil typed the following C++ code and during compilation he found three errors as follows:

(i) Function `strlen` should have prototype
(ii) Undefined symbol `cout`
(iii) Undefined symbol `endl`

On asking, his teacher told him to include necessary header files in the code. Write the names of the header files which Anil needs to include for successful compilation and execution of the following code:

```cpp
void main()
{
    char Txt[] = "Welcome";
    for (int C = 0; C < strlen(Txt); C++)
        Txt[c] = Txt[c] + 1;
    Cout << Txt << end;
}
```

**Answer:**
```
string.h
iostream.h   OR   fstream.h   OR   iomanip.h
```

    cin>>CH;
    switch (CH)
        case 'A' cout<<"Ant"; Break;
        case 'B' cout<<"Bear"; Break;
}
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void main ()                          // Error: 'Void' → 'void'
{
    cout << "Enter an Alphabet:";     // Error 1: missing semicolon
    char CH;                          // Error 2: CH not declared
    cin >> CH;
    switch (CH)
    {                                 // Error 3(i): missing opening brace
        case 'A':                     // Error 4(i): missing colon after 'A'
            cout << "Ant"; break;     // Error 5(i): 'Break' → 'break'
        case 'B':                     // Error 4(ii): missing colon after 'B'
            cout << "Bear"; break;    // Error 5(ii): 'Break' → 'break'
    }                                 // Error 3(ii): missing closing brace
}

    for (int L = 5; L >= 0; L--)
        cout << Score[L] << "*";
}
```

**Answer:**
```
12*63*73*15*93*10*
```

**Solution:**

| Index | Initial Value | Step 1 (% 10 check) | After Step 1 | Step 2 (% 5 check) | Final Value |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 0     | 100          | 100%10==0 → /=2 → 50 | 50          | 50%5==0 → /=5 → 10 | 10          |
| 1     | 95           | 95%10≠0 → -=2 → 93  | 93           | 93%5≠0              | 93          |
| 2     | 150          | 150%10==0 → /=2 → 75 | 75          | 75%5==0 → /=5 → 15 | 15          |
| 3     | 75           | 75%10≠0 → -=2 → 73  | 73           | 73%5≠0              | 73          |

### Q1(f). — 2 Marks
Look at the following C++ code and find the possible output(s) from the options (i) to (iv) following it. Also, write the maximum values that can be assigned to each of the variables N and M.

> **Note:**
> - Assume all the required header files are already being included in the code.
> - The function `random(n)` generates an integer between 0 and n–1.

```cpp
void main()
{
    Randomize();
    int N = random(3), M = random(4);
    int DOCK[3][3] = {{1,2,3},{2,3,4},{3,4,5}};
    for (int R = 0; R = 0; R < N; R++)
    {
        for (int C = 0; C < M; C++)
            cout << DOCK[R][C] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

Options:

| (i)         | (ii)      |
|-------------|-----------|
| 1 2 3       | 1 2 3     |
| 2 3 4       | 2 3 4     |
| 3 4 5       |           |

| (iii)  | (iv)   |
|--------|--------|
| 1 2    | 1 2    |
| 2 3    | 2 3    |
|        | 3 4    |

**Answer:**
- Correct Options: **(ii) and (iii)**
- Maximum value of $N = 2$
- Maximum value of $M = 3$

**Solution:**
- `random(3)` generates values in range [0, 2], so maximum N = 2
- `random(4)` generates values in range [0, 3], so maximum M = 3
- The array DOCK is 3×3, so valid row indices are 0–2 and column indices 0–2
- Option (i) requires N=3 (impossible, max is 2) — **invalid**
- Option (iv) requires 3 rows (impossible) — **invalid**
- Options (ii) (N=2, M=3) and (iii) (N=2, M=2) are valid

## Q2.

### Q2(a). — 2 Marks
Differentiate between protected and private members of a class in context of Object Oriented Programming. Also give a suitable example illustrating accessibility/non-accessibility of each using a class and an object in C++.

**Answer:**

| Private | Protected |
|---------|-----------|
| Implicit Visibility Mode | Explicit Visibility Mode |
| Not accessible to member functions of derived class | Accessible to member functions of derived class |

**Example:**
```cpp
class A
{
    int x;          // private (implicit)
protected:
    int y;          // protected (explicit)
public:
    void z();       // public
};
```

- `x` is private — not accessible in derived class
- `y` is protected — accessible in derived class member functions
- `z` is public — accessible everywhere

## Q3.

### Q3(a). — 3 Marks
Write the definition of a function `AddUp(int Arr[], int N)` in C++, in which all even positions (i.e., 0, 2, 4, …) of the array should be added with the content of the element in the next position, and odd positions (i.e., 1, 3, 5, …) elements should be incremented by 10.

**Example:** If the array Arr contains:

| 23 | 30 | 45 | 10 | 15 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|-----|

Then the array should become:

| 53 | 40 | 55 | 20 | 40 | 25 |
|----|----|----|----|----|-----|

> **Note:**
> - The function should only alter the content in the same array.
> - The function should not copy the altered content in another array.
> - The function should not display the altered content of the array.
> - Assuming the number of elements in the array are Even.

**Answer:**

```cpp
void AddUp(int Arr[], int N)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
            Arr[i] = Arr[i] + Arr[i + 1];
        else
            Arr[i] = Arr[i] + 10;
    }
}
```

---

### Q3(b). — 2 Marks
Write a definition for a function `SUMMIDCOL(int MATRIX[][10], int N, int M)` in C++, which finds the sum of the middle column's elements of the MATRIX (Assuming N represents number of rows and M represents number of columns, which is an odd integer).

**Example:** If the content of array MATRIX having N as 5 and M as 3 is as follows:

| 1 | 2 | 1 |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1 | 4 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 4 | 5 | 3 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 |

The function should calculate the sum and display:
```
Sum of Middle Column: 15
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void SUMMIDCOL(int MATRIX[][10], int N, int M)
{
    int mid = M / 2;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        sum = sum + MATRIX[i][mid];
    }
    cout << "Sum of Middle Column: " << sum;
}
```

### Q3(c). — 3 Marks
ARR[15][20] is a two-dimensional array, which is stored in the memory along the row with each of its elements occupying 4 bytes. Find the address of the element ARR[5][15], if the element ARR[10][5] is stored at the memory location 35000.

**Answer:**

Using Row Major formula:

$$\text{Loc}(ARR[I][J]) = \text{BaseAddress} + W \times [(I - LBR) \times C + (J - LBC)]$$

Where:
- $W = 4$ bytes (size of each element)
- $R = 15$ (Number of Rows)
- $C = 20$ (Number of Columns)
- Assuming $LBR = LBC = 0$

**Step 1: Find BaseAddress using ARR[10][5]:**

$$35000 = \text{BaseAddress} + 4 \times (10 \times 20 + 5)$$

$$35000 = \text{BaseAddress} + 4 \times 205$$

$$35000 = \text{BaseAddress} + 820$$

$$\text{BaseAddress} = 35000 - 820 = 34180$$

**Step 2: Find address of ARR[5][15]:**

$$\text{Loc}(ARR[5][15]) = 34180 + 4 \times (5 \times 20 + 15)$$

$$= 34180 + 4 \times (100 + 15)$$

$$= 34180 + 4 \times 115$$

$$= 34180 + 460$$

$$= \mathbf{34640}$$

## Q4.

### Q4(a). — 3 Marks
Polina Raj has used a text editing software to type some text in an article. After saving the article as MYNOTES.TXT, she realised that she has wrongly typed alphabet K in place of alphabet C everywhere in the article.

Write a function definition for `PURETEXT()` in C++ that would display the corrected version of the entire article of the file MYNOTES.TXT with all the alphabets "K" to be displayed as an alphabet "C" on screen.

> **Note:** Assuming that MYNOTES.TXT does not contain any C alphabet otherwise.

**Example:**
If Polina has stored the following content in the file MYNOTES.TXT:
```
I OWN A KUTE LITTLE KAR.
I KARE FOR IT AS MY KHILD.
```
The function `PURETEXT()` should display:
```
I OWN A CUTE LITTLE CAR.
I CARE FOR IT AS MY CHILD.
```

**Answer:**

```cpp
void PURETEXT()
{
    char ch;
    ifstream F("MYNOTES.TXT");
    while (F.get(ch))
    {
        if (ch == 'K')
            ch = 'C';
        cout << ch;

class PHOTOS
{
    int PCODE;
    char PTYPE[20];    // Photo Type as "PORTRAIT", "NATURE"
public:
    void ENTER()
    {
        cin >> PCODE;
        gets(PTYPE);
    }
    void SHOWCASE()
    {
        cout << PCODE << ":" << PTYPE << endl;
    }
    char *GETPTYPE()
    {
        return PTYPE;
    }

### Q4(c). — 1 Mark
Find the output of the following C++ code considering that the binary file CLIENTS.DAT exists on the hard disk with a data of 200 clients:

```cpp
class CLIENTS
{
    int CCode;
    char CName[20];
public:
    void REGISTER();
    void DISPLAY();
};

void main()
{
    fstream File;
    File.open("CLIENTS.DAT", ios::binary | ios::in);
    CLIENTS C;
    File.seekg(6 * sizeof(C));
    File.read((char*)&C, sizeof(C));
    cout << "Client Number:" << File.tellg() / sizeof(C) + 1;
    File.seekg(0, ios::end);
    cout << " of " << File.tellg() / sizeof(C) << endl;
    File.close();
}
```

**Answer:**
```
Client Number: 8 of 200
```

**Solution:**
- `seekg(6 * sizeof(C))` moves pointer to the 7th record (0-indexed)
- After reading one record, `tellg()` points to position 7 (0-indexed) → `7/1 + 1 = 8`
- `seekg(0, ios::end)` moves to end → `tellg()` = 200 records total

### Q1(c). — 2 Marks
Rewrite the following code in Python after removing all syntax error(s). Underline each correction done in the code.

```python
STRING=""WELCOME
NOTE""
for S in range[0,8]:
    print STRING(S)
print S+STRING
```

**Answer:**

```python
STRING = "WELCOME"          # Correction 1: fixed string quotes
NOTE = " "                  # Correction 2: separate assignment
for S in range(0, 7):       # Correction 3: [] → () ; range(0,8) causes index error, use range(0,7)
    print STRING[S]         # Correction 4: () → [] (string indexing)
    print S, STRING         # Correction 5: S+STRING → S, STRING
```

**Solution:** 
- `""WELCOME NOTE""` is invalid string syntax — should use single quotes or split into two separate assignments
- `range[0,8]` uses square brackets — should be `range(0,8)` with parentheses
- `range(0,8)` would cause runtime index-out-of-range (string has 7 chars), should be `range(0,7)`
- `STRING(S)` uses function call syntax — should be `STRING[S]` for indexing
- `S+STRING` would concatenate int and string causing TypeError — should be `S, STRING`

## Q2.

### Q2(a). — 2 Marks
List four characteristics of Object Oriented Programming.

**Answer:**
Four characteristics of Object Oriented Programming are:
1. **Encapsulation** — bundling data and methods into a single unit (class)
2. **Data Hiding** — restricting access to internal details
3. **Inheritance** — deriving new classes from existing classes
4. **Polymorphism** — ability of the same function/operator to behave differently in different contexts

### Q2(b). — 2 Marks

```python
class Exam:
    Regno = 1
    Marks = 75
    def __init__(self, r, m):    # function 1
        self.Regno = r
        self.Marks = m
    def Assign(self, r, m):      # function 2
        Regno = r
        Marks = m
    def Check(self):             # function 3
        print self.Regno, self.Marks
        print Regno, Marks
```

#### Q2(b)(i). — 1 Mark
In the above class definition, both function 1 and function 2 have similar definitions. How are they different in execution?

**Answer:**
- **Function 1** (`__init__`) is the **constructor**, which is called **automatically** when a class object is created. It uses `self` to assign values to **instance attributes**.
- **Function 2** (`Assign`) is a **regular member function** that must be **explicitly invoked**. Without `self`, it assigns to **local variables** (not instance attributes), so it does not actually modify the object's state.

---

#### Q2(b)(ii). — 1 Mark
Write statements to execute function 1 and function 2.

**Answer:**
```python
E1 = Exam(1, 95)       # Executes Function 1 (constructor) — any values in parameters
E1.Assign(1, 95)       # Executes Function 2 — any values in parameters
```

### Q2(c). — 4 Marks
Define a class BOX in Python with the following specifications:

**Instance Attributes:**
- `BoxID` — Numeric value with a default value 101
- `Side` — Numeric value with a default value 10
- `Area` — Numeric value with a default value 0

**Methods:**
- `ExecArea()` — Method to calculate Area as `Side * Side`
- `NewBox()` — Method to allow user to enter values of BoxID and Side; it should also call `ExecArea` method
- `ViewBox()` — Method to display all the Attributes

**Answer:**

```python
class BOX:                          # can also be: class BOX(): or class BOX(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.BoxID = 101
        self.Side = 10
        self.Area = 0

    def ExecArea(self):
        self.Area = self.Side * self.Side

    def NewBox(self):
        self.BoxID = input("Enter BoxID: ")
        self.Side = input("Enter Side: ")
        self.ExecArea()             # OR ExecArea(self)

    def ViewBox(self):
        print self.BoxID
        print self.Side
        print self.Area
```

### Q2(d). — 2 Marks
Differentiate between static and dynamic binding in Python. Give suitable examples of each.

**Answer:**

**Static Binding:**
It enables linking of function calls to function definitions during **program compilation** (compile time). The method to be called is determined at compile time.

```python
# Example of Static Binding
def area(r):
    print 3.14 * r * r

area(5)    # resolved at compile time
```

**Dynamic Binding:**
It allows linking of a function **while the program is running** (runtime). The code of the function to be linked is unknown until it is executed. This makes programs more flexible and versatile.

```python
# Example of Dynamic Binding
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print "Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print "Meow"

a = Dog()
a.sound()    # resolved at runtime — Dynamic Binding
```

### Q2(e). — 2 Marks
Write two methods in Python using the concept of Function Overloading (Polymorphism) to perform the following operations:

(i) A function having one argument as Radius, to calculate Area of Circle as $3.14 \times Radius \times Radius$

(ii) A function having two arguments as Base and Height, to calculate Area of right-angled triangle as $0.5 \times Base \times Height$

**Answer:**

```python
def Area(R):
    print 3.14 * R * R

def Area(B, H):
    print 0.5 * B * H
```

> **Note:** Python does not natively support function overloading (the second definition overwrites the first). To implement true polymorphism in Python, default arguments or `*args` are typically used.

Draw the Logic Circuit of the following Boolean Expression using only NOR Gates:

$$(A + B) \cdot (C + D)$$

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Logic circuit using only NOR gates for (A+B)·(C+D)]

- NOR Gate 1: Inputs A, B → Output = $\overline{A+B}$
- NOR Gate 2: Inputs C, D → Output = $\overline{C+D}$
- NOR Gate 3: Inputs $\overline{A+B}$, $\overline{A+B}$ (same input, acts as NOT) → Output = $(A+B)$
- NOR Gate 4: Inputs $\overline{C+D}$, $\overline{C+D}$ (same input, acts as NOT) → Output = $(C+D)$
- NOR Gate 5: Inputs $(A+B)$, $(C+D)$ → Output = $\overline{(A+B)+(C+D)}$
- NOR Gate 6: Inputs output of Gate 5, output of Gate 5 (acts as NOT) → Final Output = $(A+B)\cdot(C+D)$

Using NOR as universal gate:
- $A$ NOR $A$ = $\overline{A}$ (NOT gate)
- $(A$ NOR $B)$ NOR $(A$ NOR $B)$ = $A+B$ (OR gate)
- $(A$ NOR $A)$ NOR $(B$ NOR $B)$ = $A \cdot B$ (AND gate)

Derive a Canonical POS expression for a Boolean function G, represented by the following truth table:

| X | Y | Z | G(X,Y,Z) |
|---|---|---|----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0        |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0        |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1        |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0        |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1        |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1        |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0        |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1        |

**Answer:**

POS uses the rows where G = 0 (minterms 0, 1, 3, 6):

- Row 0 (X=0, Y=0, Z=0): Maxterm = $(X + Y + Z)$
- Row 1 (X=0, Y=0, Z=1): Maxterm = $(X + Y + \overline{Z})$
- Row 3 (X=0, Y=1, Z=1): Maxterm = $(X + \overline{Y} + \overline{Z})$
- Row 6 (X=1, Y=1, Z=0): Maxterm = $(\overline{X} + \overline{Y} + Z)$

$$G(X,Y,Z) = (X+Y+Z) \cdot (X+Y+\overline{Z}) \cdot (X+\overline{Y}+\overline{Z}) \cdot (\overline{X}+\overline{Y}+Z)$$

Reduce the following Boolean Expression using K-Map:

$$E(U, V, Z, W) = \sum(2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)$$

**Answer:**

**K-Map (4 variables: U, V, Z, W):**

|           | UV'(00) | U'V(01) | UV(11) | UV'(10) |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Z'W'(00)** |         |         | 1(12)  | 1(8)    |
| **Z'W(01)**  |         |         | 1(13)  | 1(9)    |
| **ZW(11)**   | 1(3)    |         |        | 1(11)   |
| **ZW'(10)**  | 1(2)    | 1(6)    |        | 1(10)   |

**Groupings:**

- Group 1 (minterms 8,9,10,11,12,13) → Quad covering U=1 rows except (14,15): $U \cdot \overline{V}$ + UZ' pattern → **$U\overline{V}$** covers 8,9,10,11 and **$U\overline{Z}$** covers 8,9,12,13
- Group 2 (minterms 2,3) → $\overline{U}\overline{V}Z$ : **$\overline{U}\overline{V}Z$**
- Group 3 (minterms 2,6,10,... ) → checking column: minterms 2,6 in Z=1,W=0 column with U=0: $\overline{U}ZW'$... 

**Simplified Expression:**

$$E(U,V,Z,W) = U\overline{V} + U\overline{Z} + \overline{U}\overline{V}Z$$

Janish Khanna used a pen drive to copy files from his friend's laptop to his office computer. Soon his computer started abnormal functioning. Sometimes it would restart by itself and sometimes it would stop different applications running on it. Which of the following options out of (i) to (iv) would have caused the malfunctioning of the computer? Justify the reason for your chosen option.

(i) Computer Virus
(ii) Spam Mail
(iii) Computer Bacteria
(iv) Trojan Horse

**Answer:** **(i) Computer Virus**

**Justification:**
- A pen drive was used to copy files **before** the abnormal functioning started, indicating the pen drive was the carrier medium
- **Computer Virus** is a malicious program that spreads through storage media (like pen drives) and executable files
- Computer Virus affects system files and causes **abnormal functioning** such as random restarts and application crashes
- Spam Mail requires email access — not applicable here since the medium was a pen drive
- Computer Bacteria replicates itself but doesn't necessarily cause application crashes
- Trojan Horse typically disguises as legitimate software and is usually downloaded from the internet, not typically spread via pen drives in this scenario
