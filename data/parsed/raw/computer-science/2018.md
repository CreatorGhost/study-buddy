## Section A

### Q1(a).
Identify which of the following are Keywords and which are Identifiers:
(i) else
(ii) Long
(iii) 4Queue
(iv) _count

**Answer:**
- (i) `else` → **Keyword**
- (ii) `Long` → **Keyword**
- (iii) `4Queue` → **Identifier**
- (iv) `_count` → **Identifier**

---

### Q1(b).
Name the header files that need to be included for the following program to work correctly (related to file handling and string operations).

**Answer:**
```
fstream.h
string.h
```

---

### Q1(c).
Write the output of the following C++ program:

```cpp
typedef int Count;
void main()
{
    Count C;
    cout << "Enter the count:";
    cin >> C;
    for (int K = 1; K <= C; K++)
        cout << C << "*" << K << endl;
}
```

**Answer:**
```cpp
typedef int Count;
void main()
{
    Count C;
    cout << "Enter the count:";
    cin >> C;
    for (int K = 1; K <= C; K++)
        cout << C << "*" << K << endl;
}
```

**Solution:** The program defines `Count` as an alias for `int` using `typedef`. It reads a value into `C`, then prints `C * K` for each value of `K` from 1 to `C`.

**Answer:**

**(i)** **Single Inheritance**

**(ii)**
```cpp
S.display();          // Calls derived class display()
S.First::display();   // Calls base class display() explicitly
```

---

### Q2(c).
Define a class `CONTAINER` in C++ with the following specifications:
- **Private members:** `Radius` (float), `Height` (float), `Type` (int), `Volume` (float)
- **Overloaded private member functions:**
  - `CalVolume(float Radius, float Height, int n)` — for cone: $Volume = \frac{\pi \times Radius^2 \times Height}{n}$
  - `CalVolume(float Radius, float Height)` — for cylinder: $Volume = \pi \times Radius^2 \times Height$
- **Public member functions:**
  - `GetValues()` — to input values and call appropriate `CalVolume`
  - `ShowAll()` — to display Radius, Height, Volume

**Answer:**
```cpp
class CONTAINER
{
    float Radius, Height;
    int Type;
    float Volume;

    void CalVolume(float Radius, float Height, int n)
    {
        Volume = (3.14 * Radius * Radius * Height) / n;
    }

    void CalVolume(float Radius, float Height)
    {
        Volume = 3.14 * Radius * Radius * Height;
    }

public:
    void GetValues()
    {
        cout << "Enter Radius";
        cin >> Radius;
        cout << "Enter Height";
        cin >> Height;
        cout << "Enter Type (1 for cone and 2 for cylinder)";
        cin >> Type;
        switch(Type)
        {
            case 1: CalVolume(Radius, Height, 3);
                    ShowAll();
                    break;
            case 2: CalVolume(Radius, Height);
                    ShowAll();
                    break;
        }
    }

    void ShowAll()
    {
        cout << "Radius : " << Radius;
        cout << "Height : " << Height;
        cout << "Volume : " << Volume;
    }
};
```

---

### Q2(d).
Based on the given class hierarchy diagram involving multiple classes, answer the following:

**(i)** What type of inheritance is shown?

**(ii)** List all the data members accessible in the derived class.

**(iii)** List all the member functions accessible from the derived class object.

**(iv)** Write the names of constructors that will be called when an object of the derived class is created.

**Answer:**

**(i)** **Multiple Inheritance**

**(ii)** Data members accessible:
```
DD, MM, YYYY, Title[30], Name[20]
```

**(iii)** Member functions accessible:
```
Start(), View(), Initiate(), Display(), Enter(), Show()
```

**(iv)** Constructors called:
```
Schedule(), Course(), Teacher()
```

### Q3(a).
Write a function `sumEO(int VALUES[], int N)` in C++ to find and display separately the sum of all even and odd values stored in the array `VALUES` of size `N`.

**Answer:**
```cpp
void sumEO(int VALUES[], int N)
{
    int S1 = 0;
    int S2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        if (VALUES[i] % 2 == 0)
        {
            S1 += VALUES[i];
        }
        else
        {
            S2 += VALUES[i];
        }
    }
    cout << "Sum of even values" << S1 << endl;
    cout << "Sum of odd values" << S2 << endl;
}
```

**Solution:** The function iterates through the array. If an element is divisible by 2, it is added to `S1` (sum of even values); otherwise to `S2` (sum of odd values). Both sums are displayed at the end.

---

### Q3(b).
Write a function `UpperHalf(int Mat[4][4])` in C++ to display the upper half of a 4×4 matrix.

**Answer:**
```cpp
void UpperHalf(int Mat[4][4])
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
        {
            cout << Mat[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

---

### Q3(c).
An array `Data[20][15]` is stored in memory along rows with each element occupying 2 bytes. Find the address of `Data[10][5]`, if `Data[15][10]` is stored at memory location 15000.

**Answer:**

Given:
- $W = 2$ bytes
- $N = 20$ (rows)
- $M = 15$ (columns)
- $\text{Loc}(\text{Data}[15][10]) = 15000$

Using **Row Major Formula:**

$$\text{Loc}(\text{Data}[i][j]) = \text{Base}(\text{Data}) + W \times (M \times i + j)$$

$$\text{Loc}(\text{Data}[15][10]) = \text{Base}(\text{Data}) + 2 \times (15 \times 15 + 10)$$

$$15000 = \text{Base}(\text{Data}) + 2 \times (225 + 10)$$

$$15000 = \text{Base}(\text{Data}) + 2 \times 235$$

$$15000 = \text{Base}(\text{Data}) + 470$$

$$\text{Base}(\text{Data}) = 15000 - 470 = 14530$$

Now finding $\text{Loc}(\text{Data}[10][5])$:

$$\text{Loc}(\text{Data}[10][5]) = 14530 + 2 \times (15 \times 10 + 5)$$

$$= 14530 + 2 \times (150 + 5)$$

$$= 14530 + 2 \times 155$$

$$= 14530 + 310$$

$$= \mathbf{14840}$$

### Q3(d).
Write the functions `QUEUE::AddPacket()` and `QUEUE::DeletePacket()` in C++ to implement insertion and deletion operations on a linked list-based queue of `Packet` nodes (each having `PID` and `Link`).

**Answer:**

```cpp
void QUEUE::AddPacket()
{
    Packet *temp = new Packet;
    if (temp == NULL)
    {
        cout << "Overflow" << endl;
    }
    cout << "Enter PID";
    cin >> temp->PID;
    int n = temp->PID;
    temp->Link = NULL;

    // For first node
    if (Front == NULL)
    {
        Front = Rear = temp;
    }
    else
    {
        Rear->Link = temp;
        Rear = temp;
    }
    cout << n << " has been inserted successfully." << endl;

    // Display
    if (Front == NULL)
    {
        cout << "Underflow." << endl;
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        temp = Front;
        // Will check until NULL is not found
        while (temp)
        {
            cout << temp->PID << " ";
            temp = temp->Link;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

void QUEUE::DeletePacket()
{
    if (Front == NULL)
    {
        cout << "underflow" << endl;
        return;
    }
    cout << Front->PID << " is being deleted" << endl;

    if (Front == Rear)   // If only one node is there
        Front = Rear = NULL;
    else
        Front = Front->Link;

    // Display
    if (Front == NULL)
    {
        cout << "Underflow." << endl;
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        Packet *temp = Front;
        // Will check until NULL is not found
        while (temp)
        {
            cout << temp->PID << " ";
            temp = temp->Link;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Q3(e).
Convert the following infix expression to postfix form, showing the stack contents at each step:

$$U * V + (W - Z) / X$$

**Answer:**

| Symbol | Stack     | Expression      |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| U      |           | U               |
| *      | *         | U               |
| V      | *         | UV              |
| +      | +         | UV*             |
| (      | + (       | UV*             |
| W      | + (       | UV*W            |
| –      | + ( –     | UV*W            |
| Z      | + ( –     | UV*WZ           |
| )      | +         | UV*WZ–          |
| /      | + /       | UV*WZ–          |
| X      | + /       | UV*WZ–X         |
|        | +         | UV*WZ–X/        |
|        |           | UV*WZ–X/+       |

**Postfix Expression:** $UV*WZ-X/+$

## Section B — File Handling

### Q4(a).
Write a function `HashDisplay()` in C++ to read each character from a text file `MATTER.TXT` and display it on screen followed by a `#` symbol.

**Answer:**
```cpp
void HashDisplay()
{
    ifstream fin("MATTER.TXT");   // Opening text file
    int size;
    char ch;
    fin.seekg(0, ios::end);
    size = fin.tellg();
    fin.seekg(0, ios::beg);
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        fin.get(ch);
        cout << ch << "#";
    }
    fin.close();
}
```

**Solution:** The function opens the file in input mode, determines its size using `seekg` and `tellg`, then reads each character one by one using `get()` and prints it followed by `#`.

---

### Q4(b).
Write a function `TotalTeachers()` in C++ to count and display the total number of teachers from a binary file `SCHOOLS.DAT` containing records of type `SCHOOLS`. Also write the member function `putnot()` to display the `NOT` field.

**Answer:**
```cpp
void putnot()
{
    cout << NOT << " ";
}

void TotalTeachers()
{
    fstream f;
    SCHOOLS Stu;
    f.open("SCHOOLS.DAT", ios::in | ios::binary);
    cout << "\nTotal no. of Teachers : \n";
    while ((f.read((char*) &Stu, sizeof(Stu))) != NULL)
        Stu.putnot();
    f.close();
}
```

**Solution:** The function opens the binary file, reads records one by one into a `SCHOOLS` object, and calls `putnot()` on each to display the number of teachers (`NOT` field).

---

### Q4(c).
Assuming a binary file `SPORTS.DAT` contains records of type `SPORTS` (each record 30 bytes), find the record number of the record with `SCode` = "S05" if it is the 7th record in the file.

**Answer:**

**Record : 7**

**Solution:** `seekg((7-1) * sizeof(SPORTS))` would position the file pointer at the 7th record. The record number (0-indexed) would be 6, but in 1-indexed terms the answer is **Record 7**.

---

## Section C — For All Candidates

### Q5(a).
From the given tables `VIDEO` and `MEMBER`, identify the operation and find the Degree and Cardinality of the result of:

$$\text{VIDEO} \times \text{MEMBER}$$

**Answer:**

**(iv)** Operation: **CARTESIAN PRODUCT** — $\text{VIDEO} \times \text{MEMBER}$

- **Degree:** 5 (total number of columns from both tables combined)
- **Cardinality:** 9 (total number of rows = rows in VIDEO × rows in MEMBER)

---

### Q5(b).
Write SQL queries for the following based on tables `ACCOUNT(ANO, ANAME, ...)` and `TRANSACT(ANO, DOT, AMOUNT, TYPE, ...)`:

**(i)** Display all records from `TRANSACT` where type is 'Deposit'.

**(ii)** Display `ANO` and `AMOUNT` for transactions done in October.

**(iii)** Display the latest date of transaction for account number 103.

**(iv)** Display `ANAME`, `ANO`, `DOT` for accounts where `AMOUNT` ≤ 3000 (joined query).

**(v)** Display `ANO` and `ANAME` for specific accounts.

**(vi)** Display `ANO` using a set operation.

**(vii)** Display `ANO`, `COUNT`, and `MIN(AMOUNT)` grouped by `ANO`.

**(viii)** Display count and sum of amounts satisfying a specific condition.

**Answer:**

**(i)**
```sql
SELECT * FROM TRANSACT WHERE TYPE = 'Deposit';
```

**(ii)**
```sql
SELECT ANO, AMOUNT FROM TRANSACT WHERE MONTH(DOT) = 10;
```

**(iii)**
```sql
SELECT DOT FROM TRANSACT WHERE ANO = 103
ORDER BY DOT DESC LIMIT = 1;
```

**(iv)**
```sql
SELECT A.ANAME, T.ANO, T.DOT
FROM ACCOUNT AS A
JOIN TRANSACT AS T ON A.ANO = T.ANO
WHERE T.AMOUNT <= 3000;
```

**(v)**

| ANO | ANAME       |
|-----|-------------|
| 103 | AliEReza    |
| 105 | Simran Kaur |

**(vi)**

| ANO |
|-----|
| 101 |
| 103 |
| 102 |

**(vii)**

| ANO | COUNT | MIN(AMOUNT) |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 101 | 2     | 2500        |
| 103 | 2     | 1000        |

**(viii)**

| Count | Sum(AMOUNT) |
|-------|-------------|
| 2     | 5000        |

### Q6(a).
Verify the Boolean identity using a truth table:

$$X(X + Y) = X$$

**Answer:**

**Truth Table:**

| $X$ | $Y$ | $X \cdot Y$ | $X + X \cdot Y$ |
|-----|-----|------------|-----------------|
| 0   | 0   | 0          | 0               |
| 0   | 1   | 0          | 0               |
| 1   | 0   | 0          | 1               |
| 1   | 1   | 1          | 1               |

**Solution:** From the truth table, the last column $X + X \cdot Y$ equals $X$ for all combinations of $X$ and $Y$. Hence the identity $X(X + Y) = X$ is verified (Absorption Law).

### Q6(b).
Draw the logic circuit for the Boolean expression:

$$(U' + V) \cdot (V' + W')$$

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Logic circuit with inputs U, V, W:
- U passes through a NOT gate to produce U'
- U' and V are fed into an OR gate to produce (U' + V)
- V passes through a NOT gate to produce V'
- W passes through a NOT gate to produce W'
- V' and W' are fed into an OR gate to produce (V' + W')
- The outputs (U' + V) and (V' + W') are fed into an AND gate to produce the final output (U' + V)·(V' + W')]

```
U ──[NOT]──> U' ──┐
                   ├──[OR]──> (U'+V) ──┐
V ────────────────┘                    ├──[AND]──> (U'+V)·(V'+W')
                                       │
V ──[NOT]──> V' ──┐                    │

**Answer:**

$$\text{Output} : (\overline{X} + \overline{Y} + Z)(X + \overline{Y} + \overline{Z})(\overline{X} + Y + \overline{Z})(\overline{X} + \overline{Y} + Z)$$

---

### Q6(d).
Minimize the following Boolean function using a Karnaugh Map (K-Map):

$$G(U, V, W, Z) = \sum(3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15)$$

**Answer:**

**K-Map:**

$$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
UV \backslash WZ & 00 & 01 & 11 & 10 \\\hline
00 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
01 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
11 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
10 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}$$

**Groups identified:**
- $WZ$ (minterms 3, 7, 11, 15) → $W \cdot Z$
- $VZ$ (minterms 5, 7, 13, 15) → $V \cdot Z$
- $\overline{U} \cdot V \cdot W$ (minterms 6, 7) → $\overline{U} \cdot V \cdot W$
- $U \cdot V \cdot \overline{W}$ (minterms 12, 13) → $U \cdot V \cdot \overline{W}$

**Minimized Expression:**

$$G(U, V, W, Z) = W \cdot Z + V \cdot Z + \overline{U} \cdot V \cdot W + U \cdot V \cdot \overline{W}$$

### Q7(a).
Differentiate between Bus Topology and Star Topology. Write two advantages and two disadvantages of Star Topology.

**Answer:**

**Bus Topology:**
A bus topology is a networking architecture that is linear, usually using one or more pieces of cable to form a single line (bus). Signals sent by one station extend the entire length of the cable to be heard by all other stations.

**Star Topology:**
A star topology is an architecture that includes a central device or hub to connect all stations together. Signals sent by a station must pass through (and are usually regenerated by) these central hubs. Since the hub sits in the center and all stations are linked through it, the architecture resembles a star.

**Advantages of Star Topology:**
1. Better performance compared to Bus topology — signals don't get transmitted to all workstations. A sent signal reaches the intended destination after passing through no more than 3–4 devices and 2–3 links.
2. Centralized management — it helps in monitoring the network easily.

**Disadvantages of Star Topology:**
1. Too much dependency on the central device — if the hub/switch fails, the whole network goes down.
2. The use of a hub, router, or switch as a central device increases the overall cost of the network.

### Q7(d).
A hospital is setting up a network connecting four buildings: Administrative Office (10 computers), Pediatrics Unit (5 computers), Orthopedics Unit (6 computers), and Neurology Unit (4 computers).

**(i)** Which building should house the main server?

**(ii)** Draw a network layout connecting all four buildings.

**(iii)** Which network device would be needed in each building?

**(iv)** Suggest the topology and type of network cable to be used.

**Answer:**

**(i)** **Administrative Office** — as this department contains the maximum number of computers (10), placing the server here decreases cabling cost for most computers and increases network efficiency.

**(ii)** Network Layout:

[Diagram: Star topology with Administrative Office at center connected to Pediatrics Unit, Orthopedics Unit, and Neurology Unit]

```
                  [Administrative Office]
                   /         |          \
     [Orthopedics Unit]  [Neurology Unit]  [Pediatrics Unit]
```

**(iii)** **Switch** — A switch would be needed in each of these buildings to interconnect the computers installed within the building.

**(iv)**
- **Topology:** Star Topology
- **Network Cable:** Coaxial Cable
