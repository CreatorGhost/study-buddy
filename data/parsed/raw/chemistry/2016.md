## Section A — 1 Mark Each

### Q1.
Write the structure of an isomer of compound C₄H₉Br which is most reactive towards S_N1 reaction.

**Answer:**

$$\begin{array}{c} \text{CH}_3 \\ | \\ \text{CH}_3 - \text{C} - \text{CH}_3 \\ | \\ \text{Br} \end{array}$$

**Solution:** S_N1 reactivity depends on the stability of the carbocation intermediate formed. A tertiary carbocation is the most stable. The isomer of C₄H₉Br that gives a tertiary carbocation is 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide), where the bromine is attached to a tertiary carbon. Its structure is:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{CH}_3}{\text{C}}}\text{(CH}_3\text{)-Br}$$

i.e., the central carbon bears three methyl groups and one Br.

### Q2.
Pb(NO₃)₂ on heating gives a brown gas which undergoes dimerization on cooling. Identify the gas.

**Answer:** The gas is NO₂ (Nitrogen dioxide).

**Solution:**

$$2\text{Pb(NO}_3)_2 \xrightarrow{\Delta} 2\text{PbO} + \text{O}_2 + 4\text{NO}_2\downarrow$$

$$\underbrace{\text{Brown gas}}_{}$$

On cooling, dimerization occurs:

$$2\text{NO}_2 \underset{\leftarrow}{\overset{\text{cooling}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \text{N}_2\text{O}_4$$

---

### Q3.
Give an example of a molecular solid and an ionic solid.

**Answer:**
- **Molecular solid:** I₂
- **Ionic solid:** NaCl

**Solution:** Molecular solids are held together by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds (e.g., I₂). Ionic solids are held together by strong electrostatic (ionic) forces between oppositely charged ions (e.g., NaCl).

---

### Q4.
Write the IUPAC name of the given compound.

[Diagram: A benzene ring with a —CH₂—CH₂—OH substituent at position 1]

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH}_2\text{-CH}_2\text{-OH}$$

**Answer:** 2-Phenylethanol

**Solution:** The parent chain is ethanol (2 carbons with —OH). A phenyl group is attached at carbon-2 of the ethanol chain, giving the IUPAC name **2-Phenylethanol**.

---

### Q5.
What is the reason for the stability of colloidal sols?

**Answer:** The charge on all colloidal particles in a solution is the same (like charges repel each other), preventing aggregation. The charge of the dispersion medium is opposite and equal, making the system electrically neutral overall. This electrostatic repulsion between similarly charged colloidal particles is the primary cause of the stability of colloidal solutions.

## Section B — 2 Marks Each

### Q6.
**(i)** Gas (A) is more soluble in water than Gas (B) at the same temperature. Which one of the two gases will have the higher value of $K_H$ (Henry's constant) and why?

**Answer:** Gas **B** will have the higher value of $K_H$.

**Solution:** According to Henry's law:

$$p = K_H \cdot x$$

where $p$ is the partial pressure of the gas and $x$ is the mole fraction of the gas dissolved. A higher $K_H$ corresponds to lower solubility. Since Gas B is less soluble than Gas A, Gas B has the higher $K_H$.

---

**(ii)** In a non-ideal solution, what type of deviation shows the formation of maximum boiling azeotropes?

**Answer:** **Negative deviation** from Raoult's law leads to the formation of maximum boiling azeotropes.

**Solution:** When intermolecular interactions between unlike molecules (A–B) are stronger than those between like molecules (A–A or B–B), the solution shows negative deviation from Raoult's law. This results in a lower vapour pressure than ideal, causing the mixture to have a higher boiling point than either pure component, forming a **maximum boiling azeotrope**.

---

### Q7.
Write the structure of the following:

**(i)** BrF₃

**Answer:**

[Diagram: BrF₃ has a T-shaped geometry. The central Br atom has two lone pairs in the equatorial positions. One F is in the axial position (top), one F is equatorial (right), and one F is axial (bottom). Two lone pairs occupy the remaining equatorial positions on Br.]

$$\begin{array}{c} \text{F} \\ / \\ \ddot{\text{Br}} - \text{F} \\ \backslash \\ \text{F} \end{array}$$

**Solution:** BrF₃ has 5 electron pairs around Br (3 bond pairs + 2 lone pairs) → sp³d hybridisation → T-shaped molecular geometry with two lone pairs in equatorial positions.

---

**(ii)** XeF₄

**Answer:**

[Diagram: XeF₄ is square planar. Xe is at the centre with four F atoms arranged at the four corners of a square. Two lone pairs occupy axial positions above and below the plane.]

$$\begin{array}{ccc} :\text{F}: & & :\text{F}: \\ & \searrow\; \text{Xe} \;/ & \\ :\text{F}: & & :\text{F}: \end{array}$$

(Two lone pairs occupy the axial positions — square planar geometry, sp³d² hybridisation)

**Solution:** XeF₄ has 6 electron pairs around Xe (4 bond pairs + 2 lone pairs) → sp³d² hybridisation → Square planar molecular geometry with lone pairs in axial positions.

---

**OR**

What happens when:

**(i)** SO₂ gas is passed through an aqueous solution of Fe³⁺ salt.

**Answer:** SO₂ acts as a reducing agent, reducing Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺. The brown colour of the iron(III) solution turns green.

$$2\text{Fe}^{3+} + \text{SO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{Fe}^{2+} + \text{SO}_4^{2-} + 4\text{H}^+$$

---

**(ii)** XeF₄ reacts with SbF₅.

**Answer:** Addition compounds (complexes) are formed:

$$\text{XeF}_4 + \text{SbF}_5 \rightarrow [\text{XeF}_3]^+ + [\text{SbF}_6]^-$$

**Solution:** XeF₄ donates F⁻ to the strong Lewis acid SbF₅, forming the ionic complex $[\text{XeF}_3]^+[\text{SbF}_6]^-$.

---

### Q8.
When a coordination compound CoCl₃·6NH₃ is mixed with AgNO₃, 3 moles of AgCl are precipitated per mole of the compound. Write:

**(i)** Structural formula of the complex.

**Answer:**

$$[\text{Co(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_3$$

[Diagram: Co at centre coordinated to 6 NH₃ ligands in an octahedral arrangement, with charge 3+. Three Cl⁻ ions are outside the coordination sphere as counter ions.]

---

**(ii)** IUPAC name of the complex.

**Answer:** **Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride**

**Solution:** Since 3 moles of AgCl are precipitated, all 3 Cl⁻ ions are outside the coordination sphere (as free ions). The central metal Co is in +3 oxidation state, coordinated to 6 NH₃ ligands. Hence the formula is $[\text{Co(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_3$ and IUPAC name is Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride.

---

### Q9.
For a reaction: $\text{H}_2 + \text{Cl}_2 \xrightarrow{h\nu} 2\text{HCl}$ &nbsp;&nbsp; Rate $= K$

**(i)** Write the order and molecularity of this reaction.

**Answer:**
- **Order:** Zero (0)
- **Molecularity:** 2 (bimolecular)

**Solution:** Since Rate $= K$ (independent of concentration of reactants), the reaction is **zero order**. Molecularity refers to the number of reacting species in the elementary step, which is 2 (one molecule of H₂ and one molecule of Cl₂), hence **molecularity = 2**.

---

**(ii)** Write the unit of $K$.

**Answer:** $\text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$

**Solution:** For a zero-order reaction: Rate $= K$

$$\text{Unit of } K = \text{Unit of Rate} = \text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$$

---

### Q10.
Write the chemical equations involved in the following reactions:

**(i)** Hoffmann-bromamide degradation reaction

**Answer:**

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{(Amide)}}{\text{Ar/R-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-NH}_2} + \text{Br}_2 + 4\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Ar/R-NH}_2 + \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{NaBr} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

where R = alkyl group and Ar = aryl group.

**Solution:** In the Hoffmann bromamide degradation, a primary amide reacts with bromine in the presence of strong base (NaOH) to yield a primary amine with one fewer carbon atom than the original amide. The carbonyl carbon is lost as carbonate.

---

**(ii)** Carbylamine reaction

**Answer:**

$$\text{Ar/R-NH}_2 + \text{CHCl}_3 + 3\text{KOH} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{Ar/R-NC} + 3\text{KCl} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

where R = alkyl group and Ar = aryl group.

**Solution:** When a primary amine is heated with chloroform and alcoholic KOH, a foul-smelling isocyanide (carbylamine) is produced. This reaction is used as a test for primary amines.

---

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q11.
An element crystallizes in a b.c.c. lattice with cell edge of 500 pm. The density of the element is 7.5 g cm⁻³. How many atoms are present in 300 g of the element?

**Answer:** $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms

**Solution:**

For b.c.c., $z = 2$.

Using the density formula:

$$d = \frac{z \times M}{N_A \times a^3}$$

$$7.5 = \frac{2 \times M}{(500 \times 10^{-10})^3 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}}$$

$$7.5 = \frac{2 \times M}{(500)^3 \times 10^{-30} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}}$$

$$M = \frac{7.5 \times 125 \times 10^{-24} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}}{2}$$

$$M = \frac{7.5 \times 125 \times 10^{-24} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}}{2} = 282.3 \text{ g mol}^{-1}$$

Number of atoms in 300 g:

$$282.3 \text{ g} = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}$$

$$300 \text{ g} = \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 300}{282.3} \approx 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ atoms}$$

---

### Q12.
For the first order thermal decomposition reaction, the following data were obtained:

$$\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{Cl(g)} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{(g)} + \text{HCl(g)}$$

| Time / sec | Total pressure / atm |
|:----------:|:--------------------:|
| 0          | 0.30                 |
| 300        | 0.50                 |

Calculate the rate constant.

*(Given: log 2 = 0.301, log 3 = 0.4771, log 4 = 0.6201)*

**Answer:** $k = 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s}^{-1}$

**Solution:**

Given: $P_0 = 0.30$ atm, $P_t = 0.50$ atm, $t = 300$ s.

For the reaction $\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{Cl} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_4 + \text{HCl}$:

If $\alpha$ is the decrease in pressure of C₂H₅Cl at time $t$:

$$P_t = P_0 - \alpha + \alpha + \alpha = P_0 + \alpha$$

$$\alpha = P_t - P_0 = 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.20 \text{ atm}$$

$$P_{\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{Cl}} = P_0 - \alpha = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10 \text{ atm}$$

Note: $2P_0 - P_t = 2(0.30) - 0.50 = 0.60 - 0.50 = 0.10$ atm (pressure of C₂H₅Cl remaining)

For first order:

$$k = \frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{P_0}{2P_0 - P_t}$$

$$k = \frac{2.303}{300} \log \frac{0.30}{0.10}$$

$$k = \frac{2.303}{300} \log 3$$

$$k = \frac{2.303}{300} \times 0.4771$$

$$k = \frac{1.099}{300}$$

$$\boxed{k = 0.0036 \text{ s}^{-1} \text{ or } 3.6 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s}^{-1}}$$

### Q13.
Define the following terms:

**(i)** Lyophilic colloid

**Answer:** Lyophilic sols are colloidal sols formed directly by combining substances like gum, gelatine, starch, and rubber with a suitable liquid (the dispersion medium). They are quite stable and cannot be coagulated easily because there is a strong affinity between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium.

---

**(ii)** Zeta potential

**Answer:** The combination of two layers of opposite charges surrounding colloidal particles is called the Helmholtz electrical double layer. The first layer of ions is firmly held (fixed layer) and the second layer is mobile (diffused layer). The potential difference between the fixed layer and the diffused layer is called the **zeta potential** or **electrokinetic potential**. It is responsible for the stability of colloidal sols.

---

**(iii)** Associated colloids

**Answer:** Some substances (like soaps and detergents) behave as normal strong electrolytes at low concentrations but exhibit colloidal behaviour at higher concentrations due to the formation of aggregates called **micelles**. These are known as **associated colloids**. The minimum concentration above which micelle formation begins is called the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC).

---

### Q14.

**(i)** Name the method of refining of nickel.

**Answer:** Nickel is refined by **Mond's process**.

**Solution:** In Mond's process, impure nickel is heated in a stream of CO at about 330–350 K to form volatile nickel tetracarbonyl $[\text{Ni(CO)}_4]$, which is then decomposed at higher temperature (~450–470 K) to give pure nickel:

$$\text{Ni} + 4\text{CO} \xrightarrow{330\text{–}350\text{ K}} \text{Ni(CO)}_4 \xrightarrow{450\text{–}470\text{ K}} \text{Ni} + 4\text{CO}$$

---

**(ii)** What is the role of cryolite in the extraction of aluminium?

**Answer:** Alumina (Al₂O₃) has a very high melting point (~2323 K). It is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na₃AlF₆), which **lowers the melting point** of the mixture to about 1140 K and also **increases the electrical conductivity** of the melt, making electrolysis feasible and economical.

---

**(iii)** What is the role of limestone in the extraction of iron from its oxides?

**Answer:** Limestone (CaCO₃) acts as a **flux**. It decomposes on heating to give CaO, which then reacts with the silica (SiO₂) impurity present in the ore to form calcium silicate (CaSiO₃) slag, which is immiscible with the molten iron and can be easily removed:

$$\text{CaCO}_3 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{CaO} + \text{CO}_2$$

$$\text{CaO} + \text{SiO}_2 \rightarrow \text{CaSiO}_3 \text{ (slag)}$$

---

### Q15.
Calculate the boiling point of the solution when 4 g of MgSO₄ (M = 120 g mol⁻¹) was dissolved in 100 g of water, assuming MgSO₄ undergoes complete ionization. ($K_b$ for water = 0.52 K kg mol⁻¹)

**Answer:** $T_b = 373.496 \text{ K}$

**Solution:**

MgSO₄ → Mg²⁺ + SO₄²⁻

So $i = 2$ (van't Hoff factor for complete dissociation into 2 ions).

$$\Delta T_b = i \times K_b \times m$$

$$\Delta T_b = i \times K_b \times \frac{W_2 \times 1000}{M \times W_1}$$

$$\Delta T_b = 2 \times 0.52 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1} \times \frac{4 \text{ g} \times 1000 \text{ g kg}^{-1}}{120 \text{ g mol}^{-1} \times 100 \text{ g}}$$

$$\Delta T_b = \frac{2 \times 0.52}{3} = \frac{1.04}{3} = 0.346 \text{ K}$$

Boiling point of water $T_b^\circ = 373.15 \text{ K}$

$$T_b = T_b^\circ + \Delta T_b = 373.15 + 0.346 = \boxed{373.496 \text{ K}}$$

---

### Q16.
Give reasons:

**(i)** SO₂ is reducing while TeO₂ is an oxidizing agent.

**Answer:** As we move down Group 16, the stability of the higher oxidation state **decreases**. Sulphur (S) is more stable in the +6 oxidation state, so SO₂ (S in +4 state) tends to get oxidised to the +6 state, acting as a **reducing agent**. Tellurium (Te) is more stable in the +4 oxidation state, so TeO₂ (Te in +4 state) tends to get reduced, acting as an **oxidizing agent**.

---

**(ii)** Nitrogen does not form pentahalide.

**Answer:** Nitrogen does not form pentahalide because it **lacks d-orbitals** in its valence shell (n = 2). To form 5 bonds, the central atom needs to expand its octet, which requires d-orbitals. Since nitrogen has no d-orbitals available, it cannot form NX₅.

---

**(iii)** ICl is more reactive than I₂.

**Answer:** In interhalogen compounds like ICl, the I–Cl bond is **weaker and more polar** than the I–I bond in I₂ (with the exception of F–F). The bond dissociation energy of I–Cl is lower than that of I–I, making ICl more reactive. Also, the polarity of the I–Cl bond (due to electronegativity difference) facilitates reactions with both nucleophiles and electrophiles.

---

### Q17.
Write the final product(s) in each of the following reactions:

**(a)**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{CH}_3}{\underset{\text{CH}_3}{\text{C}}}}\text{-O-CH}_3 + \text{HI} \longrightarrow$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \underset{\displaystyle\text{(tert-butyl iodide)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{CH}_3}{\underset{\text{CH}_3}{\text{C}}}}\text{-I}}$$

**Solution:** When a mixed ether (tert-butyl methyl ether) reacts with HI, the cleavage occurs at the bond between oxygen and the more substituted (tertiary) carbon via S_N1 mechanism, since the tertiary carbocation is more stable. This gives tert-butyl iodide and methanol.

---

**(b)**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-CH}_2\text{-CH}\text{-CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Cu/573 K}}$$

$$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad |\\ \quad\quad\quad\quad \text{OH}$$

**Answer:**

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{(Butanone / Methyl ethyl ketone)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-CH}_3}$$

**Solution:** A secondary alcohol (butan-2-ol) on dehydrogenation over copper catalyst at 573 K gives the corresponding ketone (butanone / methyl ethyl ketone).

---

**(c)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-OH} \xrightarrow{\text{(i) CHCl}_3 + \text{aq. NaOH}} \xrightarrow{\text{(ii) H}^+}$$

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Salicylaldehyde — a benzene ring with an —OH group at position 1 and a —CHO group at position 2 (ortho)]

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{(Salicylaldehyde / 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)}}{\text{o-HO-C}_6\text{H}_4\text{-CHO}}$$

**Solution:** This is the **Reimer–Tiemann reaction**. Phenol reacts with CHCl₃ in the presence of aqueous NaOH, followed by acidification, to give salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) as the major product.

---

### Q18.
Give reasons for the following:

**(i)** Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.

**Answer:** The Friedel–Crafts reaction uses AlCl₃ as a Lewis acid catalyst. Aniline (a strong Lewis base) reacts with AlCl₃ to form a salt:

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{Aniline}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2} + \text{AlCl}_3 \rightarrow \underset{\displaystyle\text{Salt}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}}\text{H}_3 \cdot \text{AlCl}_4^-}$$

[Diagram: Aniline + AlCl₃ → Salt with positive charge on N]

This positive charge on the nitrogen atom strongly **deactivates** the benzene ring towards electrophilic substitution. As a result, aniline does not undergo the Friedel–Crafts reaction.

---

**(ii)** (CH₃)₂NH is more basic than (CH₃)₃N in aqueous solution.

**Answer:** In aqueous solution, the basicity depends on:
1. The **+I effect** of alkyl groups (increases electron density on N → increases basicity).
2. **Solvation** of the conjugate acid (ammonium ion) by water through hydrogen bonding (stabilises the cation → increases basicity).

[Diagram: R–N–H (secondary) > R–N–R (tertiary) in terms of H-bonding capacity]

Although (CH₃)₃N has a greater +I effect than (CH₃)₂NH, the trimethylammonium ion $(CH_3)_3\overset{+}{N}H$ has fewer N–H bonds available for hydrogen bonding with water compared to the dimethylammonium ion $(CH_3)_2\overset{+}{N}H_2$. Therefore, the cation of (CH₃)₂NH is better solvated, making **(CH₃)₂NH more basic** than (CH₃)₃N in aqueous solution.

---

**(iii)** Primary amines have higher boiling point than tertiary amines.

**Answer:** Primary amines (R–NH₂) have **two N–H bonds** and can form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds, requiring more energy to overcome these interactions. Tertiary amines (R₃N) have **no N–H bond** and therefore **cannot form intermolecular hydrogen bonds**.

[Diagram: Primary amine — H–N···H–N···H–N chain (hydrogen bonding) vs Tertiary amine — no H on N, no H-bonding]

As a result, more energy is required to separate primary amine molecules, giving them a **higher boiling point** than tertiary amines.

---

### Q19.
How do you convert:

**(i)** Chlorobenzene to biphenyl

**Answer:**

$$2\underset{\displaystyle\text{Chlorobenzene}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Cl}} + 2\text{Na} \xrightarrow{\text{dry ether}} \underset{\displaystyle\text{Biphenyl}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-C}_6\text{H}_5} + 2\text{NaCl}$$

[Diagram: Two chlorobenzene molecules react with 2Na in dry ether to give biphenyl and 2NaCl — this is the Wurtz–Fittig reaction]

**Solution:** This is the **Wurtz–Fittig reaction**, where aryl halides react with sodium metal in dry ether to give biaryl compounds.

---

**(ii)** Propene to 1-iodopropane

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-CH=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{HBr/peroxide}} \text{CH}_3\text{-CH}_2\text{-CH}_2\text{Br} \xrightarrow{\text{NaI/acetone}} \text{CH}_3\text{-CH}_2\text{-CH}_2\text{I}$$

**Solution:** First, propene reacts with HBr in the presence of peroxide (anti-Markovnikov addition) to give 1-bromopropane. Then, 1-bromopropane undergoes a Finkelstein reaction with NaI in acetone to give 1-iodopropane.

---

**(iii)** 2-Bromobutane to but-2-ene

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-CH}_2\text{-}\underset{|}{\overset{|}{\text{C}}}\text{H(Br)-CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Alc. KOH}} \text{CH}_3\text{-CH=CH-CH}_3$$

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{2-Bromobutane}}{} \xrightarrow{\text{Alc. KOH}} \underset{\displaystyle\text{But-2-ene}}{}$$

**Solution:** 2-Bromobutane undergoes dehydrohalogenation (elimination) with alcoholic KOH (a strong base) to give but-2-ene (major product, following Saytzeff's rule).

---

**OR**

Write the major product(s) in the following:

**(i)**

[Diagram: A benzene ring with —CH₂—CH₃ at position 1 and —NO₂ at position 4, reacted with Br₂ under UV light]

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{1-ethyl-4-nitrobenzene}}{\text{p-NO}_2\text{-C}_6\text{H}_4\text{-CH}_2\text{CH}_3} \xrightarrow{\text{Br}_2,\; \text{UV light}} ?$$

**Answer:**

[Diagram: The product has bromine substituted at the benzylic carbon (the —CHBr—CH₃ group) at position 1, with the NO₂ group still at position 4 — i.e., 1-(1-bromoethyl)-4-nitrobenzene]

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{1-(1-bromoethyl)-4-nitrobenzene}}{\text{p-NO}_2\text{-C}_6\text{H}_4\text{-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{Br}}{\text{CH}}}\text{-CH}_3}$$

**Solution:** In the presence of Br₂ and UV light (free radical conditions), halogenation occurs preferentially at the **benzylic position** due to the greater stability of the benzylic radical. The NO₂ group does not affect this free radical reaction.

---

**(ii)**

$$2\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{|}{\underset{\text{Cl}}{}}\text{CH-CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Na, dry ether}}$$

**Answer:**

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{2,3-dimethylbutane}}{\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{CH}_3}{\text{C}}}\text{H-}\overset{|}{\overset{\text{CH}_3}{\text{C}}}\text{H-CH}_3}$$

$$\text{i.e., } \text{CH}_3\text{-CH(CH}_3\text{)-CH(CH}_3\text{)-CH}_3$$

**Solution:** This is the **Wurtz reaction**. Two molecules of 2-chloropropane react with Na metal in dry ether to give 2,3-dimethylbutane.

---

**(iii)**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-CH}_2\text{-Br} \xrightarrow{\text{AgCN}}$$

**Answer:**

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{(Ethyl isocyanide)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{NC}}$$

**Solution:** AgCN is a covalent compound and reacts through the **carbon end** (since Ag makes CN more covalent). The carbon of CN attacks the carbon of the alkyl halide, giving an **isocyanide** (R–NC), not a nitrile.

---

### Q20.

**(i)** What is the role of Sulphur in the vulcanization of rubber?

**Answer:** During vulcanization, sulphur introduces **–S–S– (polysulphide) crosslinks** between adjacent polymer chains of natural rubber. These crosslinks restrict the free movement of the chains relative to one another, making the rubber harder, stronger, and more elastic with greater resistance to heat and chemicals.

---

**(ii)** Identify the monomers in the following polymer:

[Diagram: A repeating unit showing —O–CH₂–CH₂–O–C(=O)–C₆H₄–C(=O)–]

$$\left[\text{-O-CH}_2\text{-CH}_2\text{-O-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-}\langle\text{benzene ring}\rangle\text{-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-}\right]_n$$

**Answer:** The monomers are:

1. **Ethylene glycol:** $\text{HO-CH}_2\text{-CH}_2\text{-OH}$

2. **Terephthalic acid:** $\text{HOOC-}\langle\text{benzene ring}\rangle\text{-COOH}$ (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid)

**Solution:** This polymer is **Terylene (PET — polyethylene terephthalate)**, formed by the condensation polymerization of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.

---

**(iii)** Arrange the following polymers in the increasing order of their intermolecular forces:

**Terylene, Polythene, Neoprene**

**Answer:**

$$\text{Neoprene} < \text{Polythene} < \text{Terylene}$$

**Solution:**
- **Neoprene** is an elastomer with very weak intermolecular forces (weakest, most flexible).
- **Polythene** is a thermoplastic with moderate van der Waals forces.
- **Terylene** is a condensation polymer (polyester) with strong dipole–dipole interactions and partial hydrogen bonding (strongest intermolecular forces among the three).

### Q21.

**(i)** Write the structural difference between starch and cellulose.

**Answer:**

| Property | Starch | Cellulose |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Configuration of glucose | Glucose monomers are in **α-configuration** (α-D-glucose) | Glucose monomers are in **β-configuration** (β-D-glucose) |
| Composition | Polymer of **amylose** (linear, α-1,4 linkages) and **amylopectin** (branched, α-1,4 and α-1,6 linkages) | Linear polymer entirely of β-D-glucose units joined by **β-1,4-glycosidic** linkages |
| Structure | Can be linear or branched | Strictly linear, unbranched |

---

**(ii)** What type of linkage is present in nucleic acids?

**Answer:** **Phosphodiester linkage** — the 3′-hydroxyl group of one nucleotide is linked to the 5′-phosphate group of the next nucleotide through a phosphate ester bond, forming the backbone of the nucleic acid strand.

**(iii)** Give one example each for fibrous protein and globular protein.

**Answer:**
- **Fibrous protein:** Silk (fibroin) / Keratin
- **Globular protein:** Egg albumin / Haemoglobin / Insulin

### Q22.

**(a)** For the complex $[\text{Fe(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}$, write the hybridization, magnetic character and spin of the complex. (At. number: Fe = 26)

**Answer:**
- **Hybridization:** sp³d² (outer orbital complex)
- **Magnetic character:** Strongly **paramagnetic** (5 unpaired electrons)
- **Spin:** **High spin**

**Solution:**

Fe has atomic number 26: $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^6\ 4s^2$

Fe³⁺ (loses 3 electrons): $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^5$

Electronic arrangement of Fe³⁺:

$$3d^5: \quad \boxed{\uparrow}\boxed{\uparrow}\boxed{\uparrow}\boxed{\uparrow}\boxed{\uparrow} \quad 4s:\boxed{\times\times} \quad 4p:\boxed{\times\times}\boxed{\times\times}\boxed{\times\times} \quad 4d:\boxed{\times\times}\boxed{\times\times}\square\square\square$$

H₂O is a **weak field ligand** → does not cause pairing of electrons. All 5 d-electrons remain unpaired in the $3d^5$ configuration.

The 4s, 4p, and 4d orbitals are used for hybridization → **sp³d²** (outer orbital complex, octahedral geometry).

5 unpaired electrons → strongly paramagnetic → **high spin complex**.

---

**(b)** Draw one of the geometrical isomers of the complex $[\text{Pt(en)}_2\text{Cl}_2]^{2+}$ which is optically inactive.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Trans isomer of [Pt(en)₂Cl₂]²⁺ — a square planar complex where Pt is at centre, two en (ethylenediamine) ligands are on opposite sides (one above and one below the Pt), and two Cl atoms are on opposite sides (left and right). This trans isomer has a plane of symmetry and is optically inactive.]

$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc} & \text{Cl} & \\ \text{en} & \text{Pt} & \text{en} \\ & \text{Cl} & \end{array}\right]^{2+}$$

**Solution:** $[\text{Pt(en)}_2\text{Cl}_2]^{2+}$ has two geometrical isomers:
- **Cis isomer:** optically active (has no plane of symmetry, exists as non-superimposable mirror images).
- **Trans isomer:** optically **inactive** (has a plane of symmetry — the two Cl⁻ are trans to each other, and the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image).

The **trans isomer** is the one that is optically inactive.

### Q23.

Due to a hectic and busy schedule, Mr. Singh started taking junk food in the lunch break and slowly became habitual of eating food irregularly to excel in his field. One day during a meeting he felt severe chest pain and fell down. Mr. Khanna, a close friend of Mr. Singh, took him to the doctor immediately. The doctor diagnosed that Mr. Singh was suffering from acidity and prescribed some medicines. Mr. Khanna advised him to eat home-made food and change his lifestyle by doing yoga, meditation and some physical exercise. Mr. Singh followed his friend's advice and after a few days he started feeling better.

After reading the above passage, answer the following:

**(i)** What are the values (at least two) displayed by Mr. Khanna?

**Answer:** The two values displayed by Mr. Khanna are:
1. **Caring nature** — He immediately took Mr. Singh to the doctor in an emergency.
2. **Supportive/helpful attitude** — He advised Mr. Singh to adopt a healthier lifestyle, showing concern for his long-term well-being.

---

**(ii)** What are antacids? Give one example.

**Answer:** **Antacids** are medications used to neutralize excess hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach, thereby reducing stomach acidity and relieving symptoms like acidity, heartburn, and indigestion.

**Example:** A mixture of aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)₃] and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)₂] (commonly known as milk of magnesia). Other examples include sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) and ranitidine.

---

**(iii)** Would it be advisable to take antacids for a long period of time? Give reason.

**Answer:** **No**, it is not advisable to take antacids for a long period of time.

**Reason:** Excessive and prolonged use of antacids can make the stomach contents **alkaline**, which in turn triggers the stomach to produce **even more acid** (rebound effect). This can worsen the condition. Additionally, long-term use of certain antacids can cause side effects such as constipation (Al-based), diarrhoea (Mg-based), or electrolyte imbalances.

### Q24.

**(a)** Calculate E° for the following reaction at 298 K:

$$2\text{Al(s)} + 3\text{Cu}^{2+}(0.01\text{ M}) \rightarrow 2\text{Al}^{3+}(0.01\text{ M}) + 3\text{Cu(s)}$$

Given: $E_{\text{cell}} = 1.98 \text{ V}$

**Answer:** $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} \approx 1.9997 \text{ V} \approx 2.00 \text{ V}$

**Solution:**

Using the Nernst equation:

$$E_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591}{n} \log Q$$

For the reaction: $2\text{Al} + 3\text{Cu}^{2+} \rightarrow 2\text{Al}^{3+} + 3\text{Cu}$

Number of electrons transferred: $n = 6$

Reaction quotient:

$$Q = \frac{[\text{Al}^{3+}]^2}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]^3} = \frac{(0.01)^2}{(0.01)^3} = \frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-6}} = 10^2 = 100$$

Applying Nernst equation:

$$E_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591}{6} \log 10^2$$

$$1.98 = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591}{6} \times 2$$

$$1.98 = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591 \times 2}{6}$$

$$1.98 = E^\circ_{\text{cell}} - 0.0197$$

$$E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 1.98 + 0.0197$$

$$\boxed{E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 1.9997 \text{ V} \approx 2.00 \text{ V}}$$

---

**(b)** Using the E° values of A and B, predict which is better for coating the surface of iron [$E^\circ(\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}) = -0.44\text{ V}$] to prevent corrosion and why?

Given: $E^\circ(\text{A}^{2+}/\text{A}) = -2.37 \text{ V}$; $E^\circ(\text{B}^{2+}/\text{B}) = -0.14 \text{ V}$

**Answer:** **Metal A** is better for coating the surface of iron to prevent corrosion.

**Solution:** To prevent corrosion of iron by coating, the coating metal should act as a **sacrificial anode** (cathodic protection) — i.e., the coating metal should be more reactive (more easily oxidised) than iron.

- $E^\circ(\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}) = -0.44 \text{ V}$
- $E^\circ(\text{A}^{2+}/\text{A}) = -2.37 \text{ V}$ → more negative → more easily oxidised → more reactive than Fe → **acts as sacrificial anode**
- $E^\circ(\text{B}^{2+}/\text{B}) = -0.14 \text{ V}$ → less negative than Fe → less reactive → if coating is broken, Fe (being more reactive) would corrode faster (galvanic corrosion)

Therefore, **Metal A** (with more negative E°) provides better protection by acting as a sacrificial anode, oxidising preferentially to protect the iron underneath.

**(a)** The conductivity of 0.001 mol L⁻¹ solution of CH₃COOH is $3.905 \times 10^{-5}$ S cm⁻¹. Calculate its molar conductivity and degree of dissociation ($\alpha$).

Given: $\lambda^\circ(\text{H}^+) = 349.6$ S cm² mol⁻¹ and $\lambda^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-) = 40.9$ S cm² mol⁻¹

**Answer:** $\lambda_m = 39.05$ S cm² mol⁻¹; $\alpha = 0.1$

**Solution:**

Given: $C = 0.001$ mol L⁻¹, $\kappa = 3.905 \times 10^{-5}$ S cm⁻¹

**Molar conductivity:**

$$\lambda_m = \frac{\kappa \times 1000}{C} = \frac{3.905 \times 10^{-5} \times 1000}{0.001}$$

$$\lambda_m = \frac{3.905 \times 10^{-2}}{10^{-3}} = 39.05 \text{ S cm}^2 \text{ mol}^{-1}$$

**Molar conductivity at infinite dilution:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+$$

$$\lambda^\circ_m(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}) = \lambda^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-) + \lambda^\circ(\text{H}^+)$$

$$= 40.9 + 349.6 = 390.5 \text{ S cm}^2 \text{ mol}^{-1}$$

**Degree of dissociation:**

$$\alpha = \frac{\lambda_m}{\lambda^\circ_m} = \frac{39.05}{390.5} = 0.1$$

$$\boxed{\alpha = 0.1 \text{ (i.e., 10% dissociation)}}$$

---

**(b)** Define electrochemical cell. What happens if external potential applied becomes greater than $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ of an electrochemical cell?

**Answer:**

**Electrochemical cell:** An electrochemical cell is a device that **converts chemical energy into electrical energy** (or vice versa). It generates electricity from the energy released during a spontaneous redox reaction (in a galvanic/voltaic cell) or uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction (in an electrolytic cell).

**Effect of applying external potential greater than $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$:**

When the external potential applied to an electrochemical cell exceeds the $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ of the cell, the direction of the cell reaction is **reversed**. The galvanic cell is converted into an **electrolytic cell**, and electrolysis occurs — the non-spontaneous reverse reaction is forced to occur. This principle is the basis of **recharging** batteries and **electrolytic refining** of metals.

---

### Q25.

**(a)** Account for the following:

**(i)** Mn shows the highest oxidation state of +7 with oxygen but with fluorine it shows the highest oxidation state of +4.

**Answer:** Manganese can form **pπ–dπ bonds** with oxygen (using the 2p orbitals of oxygen and 3d orbitals of Mn), which stabilise high oxidation states, allowing Mn to reach +7 (as in KMnO₄). Fluorine, being the most electronegative element and having **no d-orbitals**, cannot form pπ–dπ bonds. Therefore, with fluorine, Mn can only achieve the highest oxidation state of **+4** (as in MnF₄).

---

**(ii)** Cr²⁺ is a strong reducing agent.

**Answer:** The electronic configuration of Cr²⁺ is $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^4$ and that of Cr³⁺ is $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^3$. The $3d^3$ configuration of Cr³⁺ is relatively more stable (half-filled t₂g subshell in octahedral field). Due to the greater stability of the **+3 oxidation state**, Cr²⁺ has a strong tendency to lose one more electron and get oxidised to Cr³⁺. Therefore, **Cr²⁺ acts as a strong reducing agent**.

---

**(iii)** Cu²⁺ salts are coloured while Zn²⁺ salts are white.

**Answer:**
- **Zn²⁺:** Electronic configuration is $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^{10}$ — the d-subshell is **completely filled**. No d–d electronic transition is possible (no vacant d-orbital of same energy). Therefore, Zn²⁺ salts do **not absorb** visible light and appear **white (colourless)**.
- **Cu²⁺:** Electronic configuration is $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^9$ — the d-subshell is **partially filled** (one vacancy). d–d transitions are possible (an electron is excited from a lower-energy d-orbital to the higher-energy d-orbital within the split d level). These transitions absorb visible light, making Cu²⁺ salts **coloured** (blue-green).

---

**(b)** Complete the following equations:

**(i)**

$$2\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{KOH} + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\Delta}$$

**Answer:**

$$2\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{KOH} + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\Delta} 2\text{K}_2\text{MnO}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

(Manganese dioxide is oxidised to potassium manganate — green coloured compound)

---

**(ii)**

$$\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} + 14\text{H}^+ + 6\text{I}^- \rightarrow$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} + 14\text{H}^+ + 6\text{I}^- \rightarrow 2\text{Cr}^{3+} + 3\text{I}_2 + 7\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Solution:** Dichromate ion ($\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-}$) is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic medium. It oxidises iodide ions (I⁻) to iodine (I₂) while Cr is reduced from +6 to +3.

**OR**

The elements of the 3d transition series are:

**Sc &nbsp; Ti &nbsp; V &nbsp; Cr &nbsp; Mn &nbsp; Fe &nbsp; Co &nbsp; Ni &nbsp; Cu &nbsp; Zn**

Answer the following:

**(i)** Write the element which shows the maximum number of oxidation states. Give a reason.

**Answer:** **Manganese (Mn)** shows the maximum number of oxidation states.

| Element | Possible Oxidation States | More Stable Oxidation States |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Mn | +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7 | +2 and +7 |

**Reason:** Mn has the electronic configuration $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^5\ 4s^2$. It has a total of **7 electrons** (5 in 3d + 2 in 4s) that can participate in bonding/oxidation. Since it is at the middle of the 3d series, it can utilise all these electrons in various oxidation states from +2 to +7.

---

**(ii)** Which element has the highest melting point?

**Answer:** **Chromium (Cr)** has the highest melting point among 3d transition elements.

**Reason:** Cr has the configuration $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^5\ 4s^1$, giving **6 unpaired electrons** (5 from 3d + 1 from 4s) that participate in the formation of strong metallic bonds. The greater the number of unpaired electrons contributing to metallic bonding, the higher the melting point.

---

**(iii)** Which element shows only +3 oxidation state?

**Answer:** **Scandium (Sc)** shows only the +3 oxidation state.

**Solution:** Sc has the configuration $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^1\ 4s^2$. It loses all 3 electrons (1 from 3d and 2 from 4s) to achieve the stable noble gas configuration of Ar. The +3 state is the only oxidation state exhibited by Sc.

---

**(iv)** Which element is a strong oxidizing agent in +3 oxidation state and why?

**Answer:** **Mn (Manganese)** is a strong oxidizing agent in the +3 oxidation state.

**Reason:** Mn³⁺ ($3d^4$) readily gets reduced to Mn²⁺ ($3d^5$) because the $3d^5$ configuration is an **extra-stable half-filled** configuration. This tendency to gain stability by acquiring the half-filled $d^5$ configuration drives Mn³⁺ to act as a strong oxidizing agent.

---

### Q26.

**(a)** Write the structures of A and B in the following reactions:

**(i)**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COCl} \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2,\; \text{Pd-BaSO}_4} \text{A} \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{N-OH}} \text{B}$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COCl} \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2,\; \text{Pd-BaSO}_4} \underset{\displaystyle\text{A (Ethanal)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{H}} \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{N-OH}} \underset{\displaystyle\text{B (Ethanal oxime)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{-C=N-OH}}$$

[Diagram: A = Ethanal (CH₃CHO); B = Ethanal oxime (CH₃CH=NOH)]

**Solution:**
- **Step 1 (A):** Rosenmund reduction — acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl) is reduced using H₂ in the presence of Pd-BaSO₄ catalyst to give **ethanal (acetaldehyde, CH₃CHO)**.
- **Step 2 (B):** Ethanal reacts with hydroxylamine (H₂N–OH) to give **ethanal oxime (CH₃CH=N–OH)**, an oxime.

---

**(ii)**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{MgBr} \xrightarrow{\text{1. CO}_2} \xrightarrow{\text{2. H}_3\text{O}^+} \text{A} \xrightarrow{\text{PCl}_5} \text{B}$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{MgBr} \xrightarrow{1.\;\text{CO}_2} \xrightarrow{2.\;\text{H}_3\text{O}^+} \underset{\displaystyle\text{A (Acetic acid)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}} \xrightarrow{\text{PCl}_5} \underset{\displaystyle\text{B (Acetyl chloride)}}{\text{CH}_3\text{COCl}} + \text{HCl} + \text{POCl}_3$$

**Solution:**
- **Step 1 (A):** Methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent) reacts with CO₂, followed by hydrolysis with H₃O⁺, to give **acetic acid (CH₃COOH)**.
- **Step 2 (B):** Acetic acid reacts with PCl₅ to give **acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl)** along with HCl and POCl₃.

---

**(b)** Distinguish between:

**(i)** C₆H₅–COCH₃ and C₆H₅–CHO

**Answer:**

Using **Tollen's reagent** (ammoniacal silver nitrate):

- **C₆H₅–CHO (Benzaldehyde):** Being an **aldehyde**, it reduces Tollen's reagent to produce a shining **silver mirror**:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CHO} + 2[\text{Ag(NH}_3)_2]^+ + 3\text{OH}^- \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COO}^- + 2\text{Ag}\downarrow + 4\text{NH}_3 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

[Diagram: Benzaldehyde + Tollen's reagent → Benzoate ion + Silver mirror (Ag)]

- **C₆H₅–COCH₃ (Acetophenone):** Being a **ketone**, it does **not** reduce Tollen's reagent → **No silver mirror** formed.

[Diagram: Acetophenone + Tollen's reagent → No silver mirror]

---

**(ii)** CH₃COOH and HCOOH

**Answer:**

Using **Tollen's reagent**:

- **HCOOH (Formic acid):** Reduces Tollen's reagent to give a **silver mirror** (formic acid has an aldehyde-like –CHO character in its structure):

$$\text{HCOOH} + 2[\text{Ag(NH}_3)_2]^+ + 2\text{OH}^- \rightarrow 2\text{Ag}\downarrow + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2 + 4\text{NH}_3$$

- **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** Does **not** reduce Tollen's reagent → **No silver mirror** formed:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \xrightarrow{\text{Tollen's reagent}} \text{No silver mirror}$$

---

**(c)** Arrange the following in the increasing order of their boiling points:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CHO}, \quad \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}, \quad \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CHO} < \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} < \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$$

**Solution:**
- **CH₃CHO (Ethanal):** Has the lowest boiling point as it is a carbonyl compound with only weak dipole–dipole interactions (no O–H hydrogen bonding).
- **CH₃CH₂OH (Ethanol):** Has a higher boiling point than ethanal due to strong **O–H···O hydrogen bonding** between alcohol molecules.
- **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid):** Has the highest boiling point because carboxylic acids form **dimers** through two strong O–H···O=C hydrogen bonds, requiring the most energy to separate.

---

**OR**

**(a)** Write the chemical reaction involved in Wolff–Kishner reduction.

**Answer:**

$$\underset{\displaystyle\text{(Aldehyde/Ketone)}}{\text{R}_1\text{-}\overset{O}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-R}_2} \xrightarrow{\text{H}_2\text{NNH}_2,\; \text{Base (KOH)}} \underset{\displaystyle\text{(Hydrazone intermediate)}}{\text{R}_1\text{-}\overset{\text{NH}_2}{\overset{\|}{C}}\text{-R}_2} \xrightarrow{\Delta,\; -\text{NH}_3} \underset{\displaystyle\text{(Alkane)}}{\text{R}_1\text{-CH}_2\text{-R}_2}$$

[Diagram: Carbonyl compound + H₂NNH₂ (hydrazine) in base → hydrazone intermediate → on heating loses NH₃ → hydrocarbon (alkane)]

**Solution:** In Wolff–Kishner reduction, a carbonyl group (–C=O) of an aldehyde or ketone is **reduced to a –CH₂– group** (i.e., the carbonyl is completely reduced to a methylene group). The carbonyl compound is first treated with hydrazine (H₂NNH₂) to form a hydrazone (R₁R₂C=NNH₂), which on heating with a base (KOH/ethylene glycol) loses N₂ to give the corresponding alkane.

---

**(b)** Arrange the following in the increasing order of their reactivity towards nucleophilic addition reaction:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COCH}_3, \quad \text{CH}_3\text{-CHO}, \quad \text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COCH}_3 < \text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3 < \text{CH}_3\text{CHO}$$

**Solution:** Nucleophilic addition reactivity depends on:
1. **Steric factors:** Bulkier groups around the carbonyl carbon reduce accessibility for the nucleophile.
2. **Electronic factors:** Electron-withdrawing groups increase the electrophilicity of the carbon
