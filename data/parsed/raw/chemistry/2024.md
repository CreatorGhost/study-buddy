### Q1.
Which one of the following first-row transition elements is expected to have the highest third ionization enthalpy?

(a) Iron (Z = 26)
(b) Manganese (Z = 25)
(c) Chromium (Z = 24)
(d) Vanadium (Z = 23)

**Answer:** (b) Manganese (Z = 25)

**Solution:** Mn (Z = 25) has the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s². After losing two electrons to form Mn²⁺, the configuration becomes [Ar] 3d⁵ — a half-filled, extra-stable configuration. Removing the third electron from this stable half-filled d⁵ configuration requires very high energy, giving Mn the highest third ionization enthalpy among the given elements.

### Q2.
Which of the following compounds will give a ketone on oxidation with chromic anhydride (CrO₃)?

(a) (CH₃)₂CH–CH₂OH
(b) CH₃CH₂CH₂OH
(c) (CH₃)₃C–OH
(d) CH₃–CH₂–CH–CH₃ (with –OH on the third carbon)

**Answer:** (a) (CH₃)₂CH–CH₂OH

**Solution:** CrO₃ oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. (CH₃)₂CH–CH₂OH contains a secondary carbon bearing the –OH group (isopropyl portion), and upon oxidation yields a ketone. Primary alcohols give aldehydes or carboxylic acids, and tertiary alcohols are resistant to oxidation under these conditions.

### Q3.
Two among the three components of DNA are β-D-2-deoxyribose and a heterocyclic base. The third component is:

(a) Adenine
(b) Phosphoric acid
(c) Sulphuric acid
(d) Uracil

**Answer:** (b) Phosphoric acid

**Solution:** DNA is composed of three types of building blocks: a pentose sugar (β-D-2-deoxyribose), a nitrogenous heterocyclic base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine), and phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄). Uracil is found in RNA, not DNA. Sulphuric acid is not a component of nucleic acids.

---

### Q4.
For an electrolyte undergoing association in a solvent, the van't Hoff factor:

(a) is always greater than one
(b) has negative value
(c) has zero value
(d) is always less than one

**Answer:** (d) is always less than one

**Solution:** When an electrolyte undergoes association, the solute particles combine to form larger aggregates, thereby reducing the total number of particles in solution. Since the van't Hoff factor $i = \dfrac{\text{observed number of particles}}{\text{expected number of particles}}$, a decrease in particle count gives $i < 1$.

---

### Q5.
For the reaction X + 2Y → P, the differential form equation of the rate law is:

(a) $\dfrac{2d[P]}{dt} = -\dfrac{d[Y]}{dt}$

(b) $-\dfrac{d[P]}{dt} = -\dfrac{d[X]}{dt}$

(c) $+\dfrac{d[X]}{dt} = -\dfrac{d[P]}{dt}$

(d) $-\dfrac{2d[Y]}{dt} = +\dfrac{d[P]}{dt}$

**Answer:** (a) $\dfrac{2d[P]}{dt} = -\dfrac{d[Y]}{dt}$

**Solution:** For the reaction X + 2Y → P, the rate is expressed as:

$$\text{Rate} = -\frac{d[X]}{dt} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d[Y]}{dt} = +\frac{d[P]}{dt}$$

From this, $\dfrac{d[P]}{dt} = -\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{d[Y]}{dt}$, which rearranges to $\dfrac{2d[P]}{dt} = -\dfrac{d[Y]}{dt}$.

---

### Q6.
The compound which undergoes SN1 reaction most rapidly is:

(a) Bromocyclohexane (Br directly on ring)
(b) (Cyclohexyl)–CH₂–Br
(c) Bromocyclopentane (Br directly on ring)
(d) Bromodiphenylmethane (Br on ring)

**Answer:** (b) (Cyclohexyl)–CH₂–Br

**Solution:** SN1 reactions proceed via the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The rate of SN1 depends on the stability of the carbocation formed. A benzyl-type or primary carbocation adjacent to a ring can be stabilised by hyperconjugation or resonance. Among the options, the compound with –CH₂–Br adjacent to the cyclohexyl ring forms a primary carbocation that is relatively stabilised, making it the fastest in SN1 under the given choices.

---

### Q7.
Acetic acid reacts with PCl₅ to give:

(a) Cl–CH₂–COCl
(b) Cl–CH₂–COOH
(c) CH₃–COCl
(d) CCl₃–COOH

**Answer:** (c) CH₃–COCl

**Solution:** When acetic acid (CH₃COOH) reacts with PCl₅, the –OH group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by –Cl, giving acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl), which is an acid chloride:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{PCl}_5 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COCl} + \text{POCl}_3 + \text{HCl}$$

---

### Q8.
The formation of cyanohydrin from an aldehyde is an example of:

(a) nucleophilic addition
(b) electrophilic addition
(c) nucleophilic substitution
(d) electrophilic substitution

**Answer:** (a) nucleophilic addition

**Solution:** In cyanohydrin formation, the cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the aldehyde. This is a classic nucleophilic addition reaction:

$$\text{RCHO} + \text{HCN} \rightarrow \text{RCH(OH)CN}$$

---

### Q9.
In the Arrhenius equation, when log k is plotted against 1/T, a straight line is obtained whose:

(a) slope is $\dfrac{A}{R}$ and intercept is $E_a$

(b) slope is A and intercept is $-\dfrac{E_a}{R}$

(c) slope is $-\dfrac{E_a}{RT}$ and intercept is log A

(d) slope is $-\dfrac{E_a}{2.303R}$ and intercept is log A

**Answer:** (d) slope is $-\dfrac{E_a}{2.303R}$ and intercept is log A

**Solution:** The Arrhenius equation is $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$. Taking the logarithm (base 10):

$$\log k = \log A - \frac{E_a}{2.303R} \cdot \frac{1}{T}$$

This is of the form $y = mx + c$, where:
- Slope $= -\dfrac{E_a}{2.303R}$
- Intercept $= \log A$

---

### Q10.
The reaction of an alkyl halide with sodium alkoxide forming ether is known as:

(a) Wurtz reaction
(b) Reimer-Tiemann reaction
(c) Williamson synthesis
(d) Kolbe reaction

**Answer:** (c) Williamson synthesis

**Solution:** Williamson synthesis involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with a sodium alkoxide (R–ONa) to form an ether:

$$\text{R–X} + \text{R'–ONa} \rightarrow \text{R–O–R'} + \text{NaX}$$

This is an SN2 reaction and is the standard laboratory method for ether synthesis.

---

### Q11.
The correct order of the ease of dehydration of the following alcohols by the action of conc. H₂SO₄ is:

(a) (CH₃)₃C–OH > (CH₃)₂CH–OH > CH₃CH₂–OH
(b) (CH₃)₂CH–OH > CH₃CH₂–OH > (CH₃)₃C–OH
(c) CH₃CH₂–OH > (CH₃)₂CH–OH > (CH₃)₃C–OH
(d) (CH₃)₂CH–OH > (CH₃)₃C–OH > CH₃CH₂–OH

**Answer:** (a) (CH₃)₃C–OH > (CH₃)₂CH–OH > CH₃CH₂–OH

**Solution:** Dehydration of alcohols proceeds via carbocation intermediates. The ease of dehydration follows the order of carbocation stability: tertiary > secondary > primary. Therefore:
- (CH₃)₃C–OH (tertiary) dehydrates most easily
- (CH₃)₂CH–OH (secondary) is next
- CH₃CH₂–OH (primary) is the most difficult to dehydrate

---

### Q12.
Which functional groups of glucose interact to form cyclic hemiacetal leading to pyranose structure?

(a) Aldehyde group and hydroxyl group at C-4
(b) Aldehyde group and hydroxyl group at C-5
(c) Ketone group and hydroxyl group at C-4
(d) Ketone group and hydroxyl group at C-5

**Answer:** (b) Aldehyde group and hydroxyl group at C-5

**Solution:** In glucose (an aldohexose), the aldehyde group at C-1 reacts intramolecularly with the hydroxyl group at C-5 to form a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal called the pyranose form. This reaction produces a new chiral centre at C-1 (the anomeric carbon), giving α and β anomers.

*For Questions 13 to 16, two statements are given — one labelled as Assertion (A) and the other labelled as Reason (R). Select the correct answer from the codes below:*

*(a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).*
*(b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).*
*(c) Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.*
*(d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.*

---

### Q13.
**Assertion (A):** When NaCl is added to water, a depression in the freezing point is observed.

**Reason (R):** NaCl undergoes dissociation in water.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** NaCl dissociates in water as: NaCl → Na⁺ + Cl⁻, increasing the number of solute particles. Depression in freezing point is a colligative property: $\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m$. Since dissociation increases $i > 1$, the freezing point is lowered. The Reason correctly explains the Assertion.

---

### Q14.
**Assertion (A):** Separation of Zr and Hf is difficult.

**Reason (R):** Zr and Hf have similar radii due to lanthanoid contraction.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** Due to lanthanoid contraction, the 4f electrons poorly shield the nuclear charge, causing Hf to have almost the same atomic radius as Zr (both ~160 pm). This similarity in size leads to nearly identical chemical properties, making their separation extremely difficult. The Reason correctly explains the Assertion.

---

### Q15.
**Assertion (A):** The pKa of ethanoic acid is lower than that of Cl–CH₂–COOH.

**Reason (R):** Chlorine shows electron withdrawing (–I) effect which increases the acidic character of Cl–CH₂–COOH.

**Answer:** (d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.

**Solution:** A lower pKa means a stronger acid. Chloroacetic acid (Cl–CH₂–COOH) is stronger than ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) due to the electron-withdrawing (–I) inductive effect of chlorine, which stabilises the carboxylate anion. Therefore, pKa of ethanoic acid is **higher** than that of chloroacetic acid — the Assertion is false. The Reason, however, is true.

---

### Q16.
**Assertion (A):** Aniline is a stronger base than ammonia.

**Reason (R):** The unshared electron pair on the nitrogen atom in aniline becomes less available for protonation due to resonance.

**Answer:** (d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.

**Solution:** In aniline, the lone pair on nitrogen is delocalised into the benzene ring through resonance, making it less available for protonation. Thus, aniline is a **weaker** base than ammonia (pKb of aniline ≈ 9.4, vs. pKb of NH₃ ≈ 4.7). The Assertion is false, but the Reason correctly describes the resonance effect and is true.

### Q17.
Calculate the potential of the Iron electrode in which the concentration of Fe²⁺ ion is 0.01 M.

$$\left(E°_{\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}} = -0.45\ \text{V at } 298\ \text{K}\right) \quad \text{Given: } \log_{10} 10 = 1$$

**Answer:** $E_{\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}} = -0.5091\ \text{V}$

**Solution:**

For the iron electrode half-reaction:

$$\text{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Fe}$$

Using the Nernst equation:

$$E = E° - \frac{0.0591}{n} \log \frac{[\text{reduced form}]}{[\text{oxidised form}]}$$

Since Fe is a solid, its activity = 1. Thus:

$$E_{\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}} = E°_{\text{Fe}^{2+}/\text{Fe}} - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \frac{1}{[\text{Fe}^{2+}]}$$

$$E = -0.45 - \frac{0.0591}{2} \log \frac{1}{0.01}$$

$$\log\left(\frac{1}{0.01}\right) = \log 100 = 2$$

$$E = -0.45 - \frac{0.0591}{2} \times 2$$

$$E = -0.45 - 0.0591$$

$$\boxed{E = -0.5091\ \text{V}}$$

Therefore, the potential of the iron electrode when [Fe²⁺] = 0.01 M is **−0.5091 V**.

### Q18.
Define molecularity of the reaction. State any one condition in which a bimolecular reaction may be kinetically of first order.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Molecularity:** The number of reacting species (atoms, ions, or molecules) that must collide simultaneously in a single elementary step to bring about that reaction is called the **molecularity** of the reaction.

**Condition for first-order kinetics in a bimolecular reaction:** If one of the two reactants is present in a very large excess compared to the other, its concentration remains effectively constant throughout the reaction. The reaction then appears to depend only on the concentration of the reactant present in smaller quantity, making it a **pseudo-first-order reaction**.

For example, the acid hydrolysis of an ester in excess water:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+} \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$$

Although bimolecular, it follows first-order kinetics because water is in large excess.

---

### Q19.
What happens when D-glucose is treated with the following reagents? (1 + 1 = 2)

(a) HI
(b) Conc. HNO₃

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Treatment with HI:**
When D-glucose is treated with HI (hydroiodic acid), all the –OH groups are reduced. The product is **n-hexane**:

$$\text{D-glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{HI}} \text{n-hexane (CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{)}$$

This confirms that glucose has a straight (unbranched) six-carbon chain.

**(b) Treatment with Conc. HNO₃:**
When D-glucose is treated with concentrated HNO₃, the aldehyde group (–CHO) at C-1 and the primary alcohol group (–CH₂OH) at C-6 are both oxidised to –COOH groups, yielding **saccharic acid** (glucaric acid), a dicarboxylic acid:

$$\text{D-glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{Conc. HNO}_3} \text{Saccharic acid (HOOC–(CHOH)}_4\text{–COOH)}$$

---

### Q20.
Draw the structures of major monohalo products in each of the following reactions:

(i) Styrene (phenyl vinyl, Ph–CH=CH₂) + HBr →
(ii) Cyclohexane + Br₂ $\xrightarrow{\text{UV light}}$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(i) Ph–CH=CH₂ + HBr →**

Addition of HBr to styrene follows Markovnikov's rule: H adds to the terminal CH₂ (less substituted carbon), and Br adds to the benzylic carbon (more substituted, forms a more stable benzylic carbocation):

$$\text{Ph–CH=CH}_2 + \text{HBr} \rightarrow \text{Ph–CHBr–CH}_3$$

Major product: **1-bromo-1-phenylethane** (PhCHBr–CH₃)

[Diagram: Benzene ring attached to CHBr–CH₃]

**(ii) Cyclohexane + Br₂ $\xrightarrow{\text{UV light}}$**

Under UV light, free radical halogenation occurs. All hydrogens in cyclohexane are equivalent, so only one monobromo product is possible:

Major product: **Bromocyclohexane**

[Diagram: Six-membered cyclohexane ring with one Br substituent at the top carbon]

**OR**

**(b) Give reasons for the following:** (1 + 1 = 2)

**(i) Grignard reagent should be prepared under anhydrous conditions.**

**Solution:** Grignard reagents (RMgX) are highly reactive organometallic compounds. They react readily with water (or any protic source) to give the corresponding hydrocarbon and destroy the reagent:

$$\text{RMgX} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{RH} + \text{Mg(OH)X}$$

To prevent this decomposition and preserve the Grignard reagent for use in organic synthesis, it must be prepared and handled under strictly **anhydrous (water-free)** conditions, typically using dry diethyl ether as solvent.

---

**(ii) Alkyl halides give alcohol with aqueous KOH whereas in the presence of alcoholic KOH, alkenes are formed.**

**Solution:**

- **Aqueous KOH:** The OH⁻ ion acts as a **nucleophile** and displaces the halide via an SN2 mechanism, forming an alcohol:

$$\text{R–X} + \text{KOH}_{(\text{aq})} \rightarrow \text{R–OH} + \text{KX}$$

- **Alcoholic KOH:** In alcoholic medium, OH⁻ acts as a **base** rather than a nucleophile. It abstracts a β-hydrogen from the alkyl halide, leading to elimination (E2 mechanism) and formation of an alkene:

$$\text{R–CH}_2\text{–CH}_2\text{X} + \text{KOH}_{(\text{alc})} \rightarrow \text{R–CH=CH}_2 + \text{KX} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

The polarity of the medium (aqueous vs. alcoholic) determines whether substitution or elimination occurs.

---

### Q21.
Write the chemical equation when: (1 + 1 = 2)

(a) Butan-2-one is treated with Zn(Hg) and conc. HCl.
(b) Two molecules of benzaldehyde are treated with conc. NaOH.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Clemmensen Reduction of Butan-2-one:**

Butan-2-one (methyl ethyl ketone) is reduced to butane using Zn(Hg)/conc. HCl (Clemmensen reduction):

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3 + 4[\text{H}] \xrightarrow{\text{Zn/Hg, HCl}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**(b) Cannizzaro Reaction of Benzaldehyde:**

Two molecules of benzaldehyde (a non-enolisable aldehyde) undergo disproportionation in the presence of conc. NaOH. One molecule is oxidised to benzoic acid (as its sodium salt) and the other is reduced to benzyl alcohol:

$$2\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CHO} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COONa}$$

### Q22.
When a certain conductivity cell was filled with 0.05 M KCl solution, it had a resistance of 100 Ω at 25°C. When the same cell was filled with 0.02 M AgNO₃ solution, the resistance was 90 Ω. Calculate the conductivity and molar conductivity of AgNO₃ solution.

(Given: Conductivity of 0.05 M KCl solution $= 1.35 \times 10^{-2}\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}$)

**Answer:** $\kappa_{\text{AgNO}_3} = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}$; $\Lambda_m = 75\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^2\text{mol}^{-1}$

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate the Cell Constant (G\*)**

$$G^* = \kappa_{\text{KCl}} \times R_{\text{KCl}}$$

$$G^* = 1.35 \times 10^{-2}\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1} \times 100\ \Omega$$

$$G^* = 1.35\ \text{cm}^{-1}$$

**Step 2: Calculate Conductivity of AgNO₃ solution**

$$\kappa_{\text{AgNO}_3} = \frac{G^*}{R_{\text{AgNO}_3}} = \frac{1.35\ \text{cm}^{-1}}{90\ \Omega}$$

$$\kappa_{\text{AgNO}_3} = 0.015 \times 10^{-2}\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{\kappa_{\text{AgNO}_3} = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}}$$

**Step 3: Calculate Molar Conductivity of AgNO₃ solution**

$$\Lambda_m = \frac{\kappa \times 1000}{C}$$

$$\Lambda_m = \frac{1.5 \times 10^{-3} \times 1000}{0.02}$$

$$\Lambda_m = \frac{1.5}{0.02}$$

$$\boxed{\Lambda_m = 75\ \Omega^{-1}\text{cm}^2\text{mol}^{-1}}$$

### Q23.
The following initial rate data were obtained for the reaction:

$$2\text{NO}(g) + \text{Br}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{NOBr}(g)$$

| Expt. No. | [NO] / mol L⁻¹ | [Br₂] / mol L⁻¹ | Initial Rate (mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 1         | 0.05           | 0.05             | $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$       |
| 2         | 0.05           | 0.15             | $3.0 \times 10^{-3}$       |
| 3         | 0.15           | 0.05             | $9.0 \times 10^{-3}$       |

(a) What is the order with respect to NO and Br₂ in the reaction?
(b) Calculate the rate constant (k).
(c) Determine the rate of reaction when [NO] = 0.4 M and [Br₂] = 0.2 M.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Determining Orders**

Let the rate law be: $\text{Rate} = k[\text{NO}]^m[\text{Br}_2]^n$

**Order with respect to NO (m):** Compare Experiments 1 and 3 (where [Br₂] is constant):

$$\frac{\text{Rate}_3}{\text{Rate}_1} = \left(\frac{[\text{NO}]_3}{[\text{NO}]_1}\right)^m$$

$$\frac{9.0 \times 10^{-3}}{1.0 \times 10^{-3}} = \left(\frac{0.15}{0.05}\right)^m$$

$$9 = 3^m \implies m = 2$$

**Order with respect to Br₂ (n):** Compare Experiments 1 and 2 (where [NO] is constant):

$$\frac{\text{Rate}_2}{\text{Rate}_1} = \left(\frac{[\text{Br}_2]_2}{[\text{Br}_2]_1}\right)^n$$

$$\frac{3.0 \times 10^{-3}}{1.0 \times 10^{-3}} = \left(\frac{0.15}{0.05}\right)^n$$

$$3 = 3^n \implies n = 1$$

**Order with respect to NO = 2; Order with respect to Br₂ = 1**

Overall rate law: $\text{Rate} = k[\text{NO}]^2[\text{Br}_2]$

---

**(b) Calculating the Rate Constant (k)**

Using data from Experiment 1:

$$1.0 \times 10^{-3} = k \times (0.05)^2 \times (0.05)$$

$$1.0 \times 10^{-3} = k \times 0.0025 \times 0.05$$

$$1.0 \times 10^{-3} = k \times 1.25 \times 10^{-4}$$

$$k = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-3}}{1.25 \times 10^{-4}}$$

$$\boxed{k = 8.0\ \text{L}^2\text{mol}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}}$$

---

**(c) Rate when [NO] = 0.4 M and [Br₂] = 0.2 M**

$$\text{Rate} = k[\text{NO}]^2[\text{Br}_2]$$

$$\text{Rate} = 8.0 \times (0.4)^2 \times 0.2$$

$$\text{Rate} = 8.0 \times 0.16 \times 0.2$$

$$\text{Rate} = 8.0 \times 0.032$$

$$\boxed{\text{Rate} = 0.256\ \text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}}$$

---

### Q24.
(a) Write the formula for the following coordination compound: (1 + 1 + ½ + ½ = 3)

**(i) Potassium tetrahydroxidozincate (II)**

**Answer:** $K_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]$

**Solution:** The central metal ion is Zn²⁺. The ligand is hydroxide (OH⁻), which is a monodentate ligand, present as four ligands (tetrahydroxido). The complex ion is $[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]^{2-}$ and the counter cation is K⁺ (two are needed for charge balance): $K_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]$.

---

**(b) Arrange the following complexes in increasing order of conductivity of their solution:**

$$[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{Cl}_2,\quad [\text{Cr(NH}_3)_3\text{Cl}_3],\quad [\text{Cr(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_3$$

**Answer:** $[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_3\text{Cl}_3] < [\text{Cr(NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{Cl}_2 < [\text{Cr(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_3$

**Solution:** Conductivity depends on the number of ions produced in solution:
- $[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_3\text{Cl}_3]$ → 0 ions (non-electrolyte), lowest conductivity
- $[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{Cl}_2$ → 3 ions (1 complex cation + 2 Cl⁻), moderate conductivity
- $[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_3$ → 4 ions (1 complex cation + 3 Cl⁻), highest conductivity

---

**(c) Identify the type of isomerism exhibited by the following complexes:**

**(i) $[\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\text{NO}_2]^{2+}$**

**Answer:** Linkage Isomerism

**Solution:** The ligand NO₂⁻ (nitrite) is an ambidentate ligand — it can coordinate to the metal either through the **nitrogen atom** (as –NO₂, nitro) or through an **oxygen atom** (as –ONO, nitrito). This gives rise to linkage isomerism in $[\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\text{NO}_2]^{2+}$.

---

**(ii) $[\text{Co(en)}_3]\text{Cl}_3$**

**Answer:** Optical Isomerism

**Solution:** Ethylenediamine (en) is a bidentate ligand. In $[\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$, three bidentate en ligands wrap around the Co³⁺ ion in an octahedral arrangement, creating a **chiral centre**. The complex exists as non-superimposable mirror images (d and l forms), exhibiting **optical isomerism**.

---

### Q25.
(a) Which of the following is an allylic halide? (3 × 1 = 3)

(i) CH₃–CH=CH–Br
(ii) CH₂=CH–CH(Br)–CH₃

**Answer:** (ii) CH₂=CH–CH(Br)–CH₃

**Solution:** An allylic halide has the halogen atom attached to a carbon that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbon–carbon double bond (C=C). In option (ii), the Br is on the carbon next to the double bond (CH₂=CH–**C**HBr–CH₃), making it an allylic halide. In option (i), the Br is directly attached to one of the sp² carbons of the double bond, making it a vinylic halide.

---

**(b) Out of chlorobenzene and 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene, which is more reactive towards nucleophilic substitution and why?**

**Answer:** 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene

**Solution:** 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene is much more reactive towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) because the three nitro groups at ortho and para positions are powerful electron-withdrawing groups. They stabilise the negatively charged Meisenheimer complex (transition state/intermediate) formed during the nucleophilic attack by withdrawing electron density from the ring. This greatly lowers the activation energy and makes the ipso carbon (bearing Cl) highly electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

---

**(c) Which isomer of C₄H₉Cl has the lowest boiling point?**

**Answer:** tert-Butyl chloride (2-chloro-2-methylpropane)

**Solution:** Among the isomers of C₄H₉Cl, tert-butyl chloride has the most compact, spherical shape with the smallest surface area. Boiling point depends on the strength of intermolecular van der Waals (London dispersion) forces, which increase with surface area. Since tert-butyl chloride has the least surface area, it has the **weakest van der Waals forces** and therefore the **lowest boiling point**.

### Q26.
(a) Write the mechanism of the following reaction: (1 + 2 = 3)

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+,\ 443\ \text{K}} \text{CH}_2 = \text{CH}_2$$

**Answer:**

**Solution:** This is acid-catalysed dehydration of ethanol to ethene. The mechanism proceeds in three steps:

**Step 1 — Protonation of the alcohol (fast):**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\overset{+}{\text{O}}\text{H}_2$$

The hydroxyl group is protonated by H⁺ (from conc. H₂SO₄) to form an oxonium ion, making –OH a better leaving group (water).

**Step 2 — Formation of carbocation (slow, rate-determining):**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\overset{+}{\text{O}}\text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\overset{+}{\text{C}}\text{H}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

Water departs, forming a primary carbocation (ethyl cation).

**Step 3 — Deprotonation to form the alkene (fast):**

$$\text{CH}_3\overset{+}{\text{C}}\text{H}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2 = \text{CH}_2 + \text{H}^+$$

A base (water or HSO₄⁻) abstracts a β-hydrogen from the carbocation, forming ethene and regenerating H⁺ (catalyst).

**Overall Reaction:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+,\ 443\ \text{K}} \text{CH}_2=\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

**(b) Write the main product in each of the following reactions:**

**(i)** $\text{CH}_3\text{–CH}_2\text{–CH=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{a) B}_2\text{H}_6} \xrightarrow{\text{b) 3H}_2\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-}$

**(ii)** Salicyl alcohol (2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, with –OH on ring) $\xrightarrow{\text{a) aq. NaOH}} \xrightarrow{\text{b) CO}_2,\ \text{H}^+}$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(i)** Hydroboration-oxidation of 1-butene:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \text{ then } \text{H}_2\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$$

Main product: **1-Butanol** (anti-Markovnikov addition of water, syn addition)

**(ii)** Kolbe–Schmitt reaction on the sodium salt of the phenol:

Starting material: 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol treated with aq. NaOH gives the phenoxide salt, then with CO₂/H⁺ undergoes carboxylation:

$$\text{2-HO-C}_6\text{H}_4\text{-CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOH then CO}_2,\ \text{H}^+} \text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\text{COOH}$$

Main product: **3-Hydroxybutanoic acid** (or as written in the solution: 2-Hydroxy-3-butenoic acid based on the starting material structure shown)

### Q27.
Answer the following (any three): (3 × 1 = 3)

(a) What is peptide linkage?
(b) What type of bonds hold a DNA double helix together?
(c) Which one of the following is a polysaccharide? Sucrose, Glucose, Starch, Fructose
(d) Give one example each for water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Peptide Linkage:**
A peptide linkage is the **amide bond** (–CO–NH–) formed between the carboxyl group (–COOH) of one amino acid and the amino group (–NH₂) of another amino acid, with the elimination of a water molecule:

$$\text{–NH–CHR–COOH} + \text{H}_2\text{N–CHR'–} \rightarrow \text{–NH–CHR–CO–NH–CHR'–} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

**(b) Bonds holding DNA double helix:**
The two strands of the DNA double helix are held together by **hydrogen bonds** between complementary base pairs: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) via 2 hydrogen bonds, and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C) via 3 hydrogen bonds.

---

**(c) Polysaccharide:**
**Starch** is a polysaccharide. Sucrose is a disaccharide; glucose and fructose are monosaccharides.

---

**(d) Examples of vitamins:**
- **Water-soluble vitamin:** Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
- **Fat-soluble vitamin:** Vitamin A (retinol)

---

### Q28.
Compound (A) (C₆H₁₂O₂) on reduction with LiAlH₄ gives two compounds (B) and (C). Compound (B) on oxidation with PCC gives compound (D) which upon treatment with dilute NaOH and subsequent heating gives compound (E). Compound (E) on catalytic hydrogenation gives compound (C). Compound (D) is oxidised further to give compound (F) which is found to be a monobasic acid (Molecular weight = 60). Identify the compounds (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F). (6 × ½ = 3)

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Working backwards from compound (F):**
F is a monobasic acid with MW = 60.
- Propanoic acid: CH₃CH₂COOH → MW = 74 (no)
- Acetic acid: CH₃COOH → MW = 60 ✓

So **F = CH₃COOH** (acetic acid / ethanoic acid)

**F is obtained by further oxidation of D:**
Since D is oxidised to acetic acid (F), D must be an aldehyde → **D = CH₃CHO** (acetaldehyde / ethanal)

**D is obtained from B by PCC oxidation (primary alcohol → aldehyde):**
→ **B = CH₃CH₂OH** (ethanol)

**D undergoes aldol condensation with dilute NaOH and heating:**

$$2\text{CH}_3\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{\text{dil. NaOH}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{CH}_3\text{CH=CHCHO} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

So **E = CH₃CH=CHCHO** (but-2-enal / crotonaldehyde)

**E on catalytic hydrogenation gives C:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH=CHCHO} + 2\text{H}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$$

So **C = CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH** (1-butanol / butan-1-ol)

**A (C₆H₁₂O₂) gives B and C on reduction with LiAlH₄:**
A gives ethanol (B) and 1-butanol (C). This is consistent with A being an **ester** — specifically ethyl butanoate or butyl acetate. Given B = ethanol (2C) and C = 1-butanol (4C): A = **ethyl butanoate, CH₃CH₂CH₂COOC₂H₅** would give 1-butanol and ethanol — but the given answer suggests:

**A = CH₃CH(OH)CH₂COOH** (3-hydroxybutanoic acid) is inconsistent. Based on the paper's provided answer:

| Compound | Identity |
|----------|----------|
| **(A)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\text{COOH}$ |
| **(B)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\text{OH}$ |
| **(C)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$ |
| **(D)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CHO}$ |
| **(E)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_2\text{OH}$ |
| **(F)** | $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$ |

## Section D — Case-Based Questions

### Q29.
**Case Study:** Batteries and fuel cells are very useful forms of galvanic cells. Any battery or cell that we use as a source of electrical energy is basically a galvanic cell. However, for a battery to be of practical use, it should be reasonably light, compact, and its voltage should not vary appreciably during its use. There are mainly two types of batteries — primary batteries and secondary batteries.

In primary batteries, the reaction occurs only once and after use over a period of time the battery becomes dead and cannot be reused again, whereas secondary batteries are rechargeable.

Production of electricity by thermal plants is not very efficient and is a major source of pollution. To solve this problem, galvanic cells are designed such that energy of combustion of fuels is directly converted into electrical energy; these are known as fuel cells. One such fuel cell was used in the Apollo space programme.

---

**(a) How do primary batteries differ from secondary batteries?** (1 mark)

**Answer:** Primary batteries are **single-use** — the electrode reactions occur only once, and once the reactants are consumed, the battery cannot be recharged. Secondary batteries are **rechargeable** — the electrode reactions are reversible and the battery can be restored to its original state by passing an electric current through it.

---

**(b) The cell potential of Mercury cell is 1.35 V, and remains constant during its life. Give reason.** (1 mark)

**Answer:** The cell potential of a mercury cell remains constant throughout its life because the **overall cell reaction does not involve any ions in solution (electrolyte)**. Both electrode reactions involve solid or insoluble species, so the concentration of the electrolyte (KOH with HgO) does not change during discharge, keeping the cell potential constant at 1.35 V.

---

**(c) Write the reactions involved in the recharging of the lead storage battery.** (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Solution:** During **recharging**, the electrode reactions (which occurred during discharge) are reversed by applying an external electric current:

**At anode (oxidation during recharge):**
$$\text{PbSO}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{PbO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{H}^+ + 2e^-$$

**At cathode (reduction during recharge):**
$$\text{PbSO}_4 + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Pb} + \text{SO}_4^{2-}$$

During recharging, PbSO₄ deposited on both electrodes during discharge is converted back to PbO₂ (positive plate) and Pb (negative plate), and H₂SO₄ is regenerated.

**OR**

**(c) Write two advantages of fuel cells over other galvanic cells.** (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

1. **Higher Efficiency:** Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of fuel directly into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions, with efficiencies of 70–75%. This is significantly higher than conventional batteries or thermal power stations (which are limited by Carnot efficiency ~40%), since energy is not wasted as heat.

2. **Continuous Operation:** Unlike conventional batteries that must be replaced or stopped for recharging, fuel cells can operate **continuously** as long as fuel (e.g., H₂) and oxidant (e.g., O₂) are supplied. There is no need to stop the device; the "fuel" can simply be replenished, making them ideal for applications requiring uninterrupted power.

---

### Q30.
**Case Study:** The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains the formation, magnetic behaviour, and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds, whereas the Crystal Field Theory (CFT) for coordination compounds is based on the effect of different crystal fields provided by ligands (taken as point charges) on the degeneracy of d-orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. The splitting of d-orbitals provides different electronic arrangements in strong and weak crystal fields. Crystal field theory attributes the colour of coordination compounds to d-d transitions of electrons. Coordination compounds find extensive applications in metallurgical processes, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

---

**(a) What is crystal field splitting energy?** (1 mark)

**Answer:** Crystal field splitting energy ($\Delta_o$ in octahedral complexes) is the **energy difference between the two sets of d-orbitals** ($e_g$ and $t_{2g}$) that arises when degenerate d-orbitals of a central metal ion are split by the electrostatic field of the approaching ligands. In an octahedral field, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals (eg set) are raised in energy, while the $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, and $d_{yz}$ orbitals (t₂g set) are lowered relative to the barycentre.

---

**(b) Give reason for the violet colour of the complex $[\text{Ti(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}$ on the basis of crystal field theory.** (1 mark)

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Ti³⁺ has a $d^1$ configuration. In the octahedral crystal field of water ligands, the single d-electron occupies the lower energy $t_{2g}$ orbital. When white light falls on the complex, the electron absorbs photons of a specific frequency (corresponding to yellow-green light, around 500 nm) and is promoted from the $t_{2g}$ level to the higher energy $e_g$ level (**d-d transition**). The complementary colour of yellow-green light is **violet**, which is transmitted, and the complex appears violet.

---

**(c) $[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$ is paramagnetic while $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$ is diamagnetic. Explain why. [Atomic No.: Cr = 24, Ni = 28]** (2 marks)

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**$[\text{Cr(NH}_3)_6]^{3+}$— Paramagnetic:**
- Cr is Z = 24: configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹; Cr³⁺ is [Ar] 3d³
- NH₃ is a moderate field ligand (weak enough not to force pairing in Cr³⁺)
- With $d^3$ configuration in octahedral field: all three electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals singly (3 unpaired electrons)
- **3 unpaired electrons → paramagnetic**

**$[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$— Diamagnetic:**
- Ni is Z = 28: configuration [Ar] 3d⁸ 4s²; Ni²⁺ is [Ar] 3d⁸
- CN⁻ is a **strong field ligand** that causes pairing of electrons
- In a square planar geometry (favoured by strong field ligands for d⁸), the 8 d-electrons are all paired in 4 orbitals
- **0 unpaired electrons → diamagnetic**

**OR**

**Explain why $[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{3-}$ is an inner orbital complex, whereas $[\text{Fe(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}$ is an outer orbital complex.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

- Fe³⁺ configuration: [Ar] 3d⁵

**$[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{3-}$ — Inner Orbital Complex:**
CN⁻ is a **strong field ligand**. It causes pairing of d-electrons, leaving two 3d orbitals empty. Hybridisation involves **inner** 3d orbitals: $d^2sp^3$ hybridisation using two 3d, one 4s, and three 4p orbitals. Since inner (3d) orbitals are used, it is called an **inner orbital complex**. It has 1 unpaired electron and is paramagnetic.

**$[\text{Fe(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{3+}$ — Outer Orbital Complex:**
H₂O is a **weak field ligand**. It cannot cause pairing; the 3d⁵ electrons remain as 5 unpaired electrons (half-filled). Hybridisation uses **outer** orbitals: $sp^3d^2$ hybridisation involving one 4s, three 4p, and two 4d orbitals. Since outer (4d) orbitals are used, it is called an **outer orbital complex**. It has 5 unpaired electrons and is strongly paramagnetic.

### Q31.
**(a)**

**(i) At the same temperature, CO₂ gas is more soluble in water than O₂ gas. Which one of them will have a higher value of K_H and why?** (1 mark)

**Answer:** **O₂** will have a higher value of $K_H$.

**Solution:** Henry's Law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the solution: $p = K_H \cdot x$, where $x$ is the mole fraction of the gas dissolved. A **higher $K_H$** means **lower solubility** (less gas dissolves at the same pressure). Since CO₂ is more soluble than O₂, CO₂ has a **lower $K_H$**, and O₂ has the **higher $K_H$**.

---

**(ii) How does the size of blood cells change when placed in an aqueous solution containing more than 0.9% (mass/volume) sodium chloride?** (1 mark)

**Answer:** The blood cells will **shrink** (undergo crenation).

**Solution:** A solution containing more than 0.9% (m/v) NaCl is **hypertonic** relative to the blood cell fluid (which is isotonic at 0.9% NaCl). When blood cells are placed in a hypertonic solution, water moves **out of the cells** into the surrounding solution by **osmosis** (from region of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration). This causes the cells to lose water and shrink — a process called **crenation**.

---

**(iii) 1 molal aqueous solution of an electrolyte A₂B₃ is 60% ionized. Calculate the boiling point of the solution.** (3 marks)

**(Given: $K_b$ for H₂O $= 0.52\ \text{K kg mol}^{-1}$)**

**Answer:** Boiling point = **101.768°C**

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Dissociation of A₂B₃**

$$\text{A}_2\text{B}_3 \rightarrow 2\text{A}^{3+} + 3\text{B}^{2-}$$

Total number of particles produced per formula unit: $n = 2 + 3 = 5$

**Step 2: Calculate the van't Hoff factor (i)**

$$i = 1 + \alpha(n - 1)$$

where $\alpha = 0.60$ (60% ionised):

$$i = 1 + 0.60 \times (5 - 1) = 1 + 0.60 \times 4 = 1 + 2.4 = 3.4$$

**Step 3: Calculate elevation in boiling point**

$$\Delta T_b = i \cdot K_b \cdot m = 3.4 \times 0.52 \times 1 = 1.768\ \text{K}$$

**Step 4: Boiling point of solution**

$$T_b = 100 + 1.768 = \boxed{101.768°\text{C}}$$

---

**OR**

**(b)**

**(i) The vapour pressures of A and B at 25°C are 75 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg, respectively. If A and B are mixed such that the mole fraction of A in the mixture is 0.4, calculate the mole fraction of B in the vapour phase.** (2 + 2 + 1 = 5)

**Answer:** Mole fraction of B in vapour phase = **0.33**

**Solution:**

Given:
- $P°_A = 75\ \text{mm Hg}$, $P°_B = 25\ \text{mm Hg}$
- $x_A = 0.4$, therefore $x_B = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$

**Using Raoult's Law:**

$$P_A = x_A \cdot P°_A = 0.4 \times 75 = 30\ \text{mm Hg}$$

$$P_B = x_B \cdot P°_B = 0.6 \times 25 = 15\ \text{mm Hg}$$

$$P_{\text{total}} = P_A + P_B = 30 + 15 = 45\ \text{mm Hg}$$

**Mole fraction of A in vapour phase (Dalton's Law):**

$$y_A = \frac{P_A}{P_{\text{total}}} = \frac{30}{45} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67$$

**Mole fraction of B in vapour phase:**

$$y_B = 1 - y_A = 1 - 0.67 = \boxed{0.33}$$

---

**(ii) Define colligative property. Which colligative property is preferred for the molar mass determination of macromolecules?**

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Colligative Property:** A colligative property is a property of a solution that **depends only on the number (concentration) of solute particles** present in the solution, and not on the nature or identity of the solute. Examples include: relative lowering of vapour pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point, and osmotic pressure.

**Preferred colligative property for macromolecules:** **Osmotic pressure** is the preferred colligative property for determining the molar mass of macromolecules (polymers, proteins, etc.) because even very dilute solutions of macromolecules produce a **measurable osmotic pressure**, whereas the other colligative effects (elevation in bp, depression in fp) are too small to measure accurately at such low concentrations.

---

**(iii) Why are equimolar solutions of sodium chloride and glucose not isotonic?**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Two solutions are isotonic if they have the same osmotic pressure (same number of solute particles per unit volume). Although equimolar solutions of NaCl and glucose have the same molarity:

- **Glucose** (C₆H₁₂O₆) does **not dissociate** in water → 1 mole gives 1 mole of particles → $i = 1$
- **NaCl** is a strong electrolyte and **dissociates** completely: NaCl → Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → 1 mole gives 2 moles of particles → $i = 2$

Since NaCl solution has twice as many particles as glucose solution at the same molarity, its **osmotic pressure is approximately twice** that of the glucose solution ($\pi = iMRT$). Therefore, equimolar solutions of NaCl and glucose are **not isotonic**.

---

### Q32.
Answer any five of the following: (5 × 1 = 5)

---

**(a) N,N-diethyl-benzenesulphonamide is insoluble in alkali. Give reason.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** In N,N-diethylbenzenesulphonamide, the nitrogen atom has **no hydrogen atom** attached to it (both N–H positions are replaced by ethyl groups). Since there is no acidic N–H hydrogen, the compound **cannot react with alkali (NaOH)** to form a water-soluble sodium salt. Therefore, it remains insoluble in alkali.

*(Note: Primary sulphonamides R–SO₂–NH₂ and secondary sulphonamides R–SO₂–NHR' dissolve in alkali because their N–H is sufficiently acidic to be deprotonated, forming soluble sodium salts.)*

---

**(b) Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction. Why?**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Friedel-Crafts reactions require a Lewis acid catalyst such as AlCl₃. Aniline (C₆H₅NH₂) does **not** undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions for two reasons:

1. The **lone pair on the nitrogen** of aniline acts as a Lewis base and forms a stable acid-base complex with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃): $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + \text{AlCl}_3 \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}}\text{H}_2 \cdot\text{AlCl}_3^-$. This deactivates and consumes the catalyst.

2. The resulting **anilinium salt** (ammonium-type ion) makes the ring electron-poor (–NH₃⁺ is a deactivating group), preventing the electrophilic substitution needed for Friedel-Crafts.

---

**(c) Write a simple chemical test to distinguish between methylamine and aniline.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** **Carbylamine (isocyanide) test** or **Diazonium salt test:**

Use the **nitrous acid (HNO₂) test** at different temperatures:

- **Methylamine** (primary aliphatic amine) reacts with HNO₂ (NaNO₂ + HCl, 0–5°C) to form an unstable diazonium salt that immediately decomposes, releasing N₂ gas with effervescence and forming methanol:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2 + \text{HNO}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{N}_2\uparrow + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

- **Aniline** (primary aromatic amine) reacts with HNO₂ at 0–5°C to form a **stable diazonium salt** (benzenediazonium chloride). When this is coupled with β-naphthol, an intense **orange-red azo dye** is formed — a positive test:
$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^- + \beta\text{-naphthol} \rightarrow \text{orange-red azo dye}$$

The formation of a stable diazonium salt (confirmed by azo coupling) identifies aniline; the immediate effervescence of N₂ identifies methylamine.

**(d) Write the chemical reaction involved in Gabriel phthalimide synthesis.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is
