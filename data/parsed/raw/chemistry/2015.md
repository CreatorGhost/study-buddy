### Q1.
Write the formulae of any two oxoacids of phosphorus.

**Answer:**
1. $H_3PO_3$ (Phosphorous acid)
2. $H_3PO_4$ (Phosphoric acid)

---

### Q2.
Which would undergo S_N2 reaction faster in the following pair:

$$C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - Br \quad \text{and} \quad C_6H_5 - CH(Br) - CH_3$$

**Answer:** $C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - Br$ undergoes S_N2 reaction faster.

**Solution:** Due to less steric hindrance, the primary alkyl halide $C_6H_5 - CH_2 - CH_2 - Br$ undergoes S_N2 reaction faster than the secondary alkyl halide.

---

### Q3.
Out of AlCl₃ and NaCl, which is more effective in causing coagulation of a negative sol and why?

**Answer:** AlCl₃ is more effective.

**Solution:** AlCl₃ is more effective due to the high positive charge density on $Al^{3+}$ as compared to $Na^+$. According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, higher the charge on the coagulating ion, greater is its coagulating power.

---

### Q4.
Write the formula of a compound in which the element Y forms ccp lattice and atoms of X occupy $\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ of tetrahedral voids.

**Answer:** $X_2Y_3$

**Solution:**

- Number of atoms of Y in CCP $= N$
- Number of tetrahedral voids $= 2N$
- Number of X atoms $= 2N \times \dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{2N}{3}$

$$\text{Ratio } x : y = \frac{2N}{3} : N = 2 : 3$$

$$\boxed{\text{Formula} = X_2Y_3}$$

### Q5.
Write the IUPAC name of the given compound:

[Diagram: Structure showing $CH_3 - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - OH$, a central carbon bearing two $CH_3$ groups, bonded to a $CH_2OH$ group]

**Answer:** 2,2-Dimethylpropan-1-ol

---

### Q6.
Why do transition elements show variable oxidation states? How is the variability in oxidation states of d-block different from that of the p-block elements?

**Answer:**

**Variable Oxidation States in Transition Elements:**
Transition elements show variable oxidation states because there is a small energy difference between the 3d and 4s orbitals. Therefore, both 3d and 4s electrons participate in bond formation, leading to variable oxidation states.

**Difference from p-block elements:**
- p-block elements show both positive and negative oxidation states.
- d-block (transition) elements show only positive oxidation states.

---

### Q7.
(i) Write down the IUPAC name of the following complex:
$$[Pt(NH_3)(H_2O)Cl_2]$$

tris(ethane-1,2-diamine)chromium(III) chloride

**Answer:**

**(i)** Ammineaquadichloridoplatinum(II)

**(ii)** $[Cr(en)_3]Cl_3$

where $en = $ ethane-1,2-diamine:

$$H_2N - CH_2 - CH_2 - NH_2$$

### Q8.
Calculate the time to deposit 1.5 g of silver at cathode when a current of 1.5 A was passed through the solution of AgNO₃.
(Molar mass of Ag $= 108\ g\ mol^{-1}$, $1\ F = 96500\ C\ mol^{-1}$)

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

$$Ag^+ + e^- \longrightarrow Ag(s)$$

$\because$ 108 g of Ag requires $= 96500\ C$

$\therefore$ 1.5 g of Ag requires:

$$= \frac{96500}{108} \times 1.5 = 1340.2\ C$$

Using $t = \dfrac{Q}{i}$:

$$t = \frac{1340.2}{1.5}$$

$$\boxed{t = 893.5 \text{ sec}}$$

---

### Q10.
(i) Why are aquatic species more comfortable in cold water than in warm water?

(ii) What happens when we place the blood cell in saline water solution (hypertonic solution)? Give reason.

**Answer:**

**(i)** Aquatic species are more comfortable in cold water than in warm water because the dissolution of $O_2$ is greater in cold water.
The dissolution of gases is an exothermic process; at lower temperatures, gases dissolve more in water (Le Chatelier's principle).

**(ii)** The blood cell will shrink (crenation/plasmolysis).
**Reason:** In a hypertonic saline solution, the concentration outside the cell is higher than inside. Water moves out of the cell through osmosis, causing it to shrink.

---

### Q11.
(i) Name the method used for the refining of titanium.

(ii) What is the role of Zn in the extraction of silver?

(iii) Reduction of metal oxide to metal becomes easier if the metal obtained is in liquid state. Why?

**Answer:**

**(i)** Van Arkel method

**(ii)** Zinc displaces silver from its complex salt solution:

$$2[Ag(CN)_2]^- + Zn \longrightarrow [Zn(CN)_4]^{2-} + 2Ag_{(s)}$$

**(iii)** When the metal is obtained in the liquid state, $\Delta S = +ve$ (entropy increases), which makes $\Delta G$ more negative, thus making the reduction easier.

---

### Q12.
(i) $E^0$ value for the $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ couple is positive $(+1.5\ V)$ whereas that of $Cr^{3+}/Cr^{2+}$ is negative $(-0.4\ V)$. Why?

(ii) Transition metals form coloured compounds. Why?

(iii) Complete the following equation:

$$2MnO_4^- + 16H^+ + 5C_2O_4^{2-} \rightarrow$$

**Answer:**

**(i)**
- The $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ couple is positive because $Mn^{3+} \rightarrow Mn^{2+}$ is favoured due to the stable half-filled ($d^5$) electronic configuration of $Mn^{2+}$, giving it reduction tendency.
- $Cr^{2+} \rightarrow Cr^{3+}$ shows oxidation tendency. $Cr^{3+}$ is more stable than $Cr^{2+}$ due to the stable $t_{2g}^3$ electronic configuration.

**(ii)** Transition metals form coloured compounds due to **d-d transitions**. When visible light falls on these compounds, electrons absorb energy and transition between d-orbitals of different energy levels, emitting the complementary colour.

**(iii)**

$$2MnO_4^- + 16H^+ + 5C_2O_4^{2-} \longrightarrow 10CO_2 + 8H_2O + 2Mn^{2+}$$

- **Hybridisation:** $d^2sp^3$
- **Shape:** Octahedral

(ii) What is the difference between acidic amino acid and basic amino acid?

(iii) Write the name of the linkage joining two nucleotides.

**Answer:**

**(i)** **Maltose** is a disaccharide.

**(ii)**
- **Acidic amino acid:** Contains more $-COOH$ groups than $-NH_2$ groups (i.e., $-COOH > -NH_2$).
- **Basic amino acid:** Contains more $-NH_2$ groups than $-COOH$ groups (i.e., $-NH_2 > -COOH$).

**(iii)** **Phosphodiester linkage**

### Q17.
Vapour pressure of water at 20°C is 17.5 mm Hg. Calculate the vapour pressure of water at 20°C when 15 g of glucose (Molar mass $= 180\ g\ mol^{-1}$) is dissolved in 150 g of water.

**Answer:**

**Given:**

$$P_A^* = 17.5\ \text{mm Hg}, \quad W_A = 150\ \text{g}, \quad M_A = 18\ \text{g mol}^{-1}$$
$$W_B = 15\ \text{g}, \quad M_B = 180\ \text{g mol}^{-1}$$

**Using Raoult's Law:**

$$\frac{P_A^* - P_s}{P_A^*} = \frac{W_B \times M_A}{M_B \times W_A}$$

$$\frac{17.5 - P_s}{17.5} = \frac{15 \times 18}{180 \times 150}$$

$$\frac{17.5 - P_s}{17.5} = \frac{270}{27000} = 0.01$$

$$17.5 - P_s = 0.175$$

$$\boxed{P_s = 17.325\ \text{mm Hg}}$$

$$CH_3 - CH = CH_2 \xrightarrow{H^+/H_2O} CH_3 - CH(OH) - CH_3$$

**(ii) Bromobenzene to 2-bromoacetophenone:**

[Diagram: Bromobenzene (benzene ring with $Br$)] $\xrightarrow{C_6H_5COCl,\ \text{An. }AlCl_3}$ [Diagram: 2-bromoacetophenone (bromobenzene ring with $-CO-C_6H_5$ at ortho position relative to $Br$)]

**(iii) 2-bromobutane to But-2-ene:**

$$CH_3 - CH_2 - CH(Br) - CH_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Alc. KOH}} CH_3 - CH = CH - CH_3$$

---

**OR**

**(i)**

$$C_2H_5Cl + NaI \xrightarrow{\text{acetone}} C_2H_5I + NaCl$$

**(ii)**

$$2C_6H_5Cl + 2Na \xrightarrow{\text{dry ether}} C_6H_5 - C_6H_5 + 2NaCl$$

### Q20.
Give reasons for the following:

(i) p-nitrophenol is more acidic than p-methylphenol.

(ii) Bond length of C–O bond in phenol is shorter than that in methanol.

(iii) $(CH_3)_3C - Br$ on reaction with sodium methoxide $(Na^+{^-}OCH_3)$ gives alkene as the main product and an ether.

**Answer:**

**(i)** p-Nitrophenol is more acidic because the $-NO_2$ group has $-I$ and $-M$ (electron-withdrawing) effects, which stabilise the phenoxide ion formed after loss of proton. The $-CH_3$ group in p-methylphenol has $+I$ and $+M$ effects, which destabilise the phenoxide ion.

**(ii)** Due to resonance in phenol, the C–O bond acquires partial double bond character. The lone pair on oxygen is delocalized into the benzene ring, giving the C–O bond a partial double bond character. In methanol, no such resonance exists. Therefore, the C–O bond in phenol is shorter than in methanol.

**(iii)**

$$( CH_3)_3C - Br + CH_3O^-Na^+ \longrightarrow H_3C - C(=CH_2) - CH_3 + NaBr + CH_3OH$$

[Diagram: Product is 2-methylpropene (major) + methyl tert-butyl ether (minor)]

Since $(CH_3)_3CBr$ is a 3° alkyl halide, it gives more preference to **elimination reaction (E2)** over substitution reaction (S_N2) because the bulky base/nucleophile $CH_3O^-$ cannot easily attack the highly hindered tertiary carbon.

---

### Q21.
Calculate $E^0_{cell}$ and $\Delta_r G^0$ for the following reaction at 25°C:

$$A^{2+} + B^+ \longrightarrow A^{3+} + B$$

Given: $K_c = 10^{10}$, $1\ F = 96500\ C\ mol^{-1}$

**Answer:**

**Step 1: Calculate $\Delta G^0$**

$$\Delta G^\circ = -2.303\ RT \log K_c$$

$$\Delta G^\circ = -2.303 \times 8.314 \times 298 \times \log 10^{10}$$

$$\Delta G^\circ = -2.303 \times 8.314 \times 298 \times 10$$

$$\boxed{\Delta G^\circ = -57058.483\ J\ mol^{-1} \approx -5.7 \times 10^4\ J\ mol^{-1}}$$

**Step 2: Calculate $E^0_{cell}$**

Using $\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ_{cell}$, where $n = 1$:

$$E^\circ_{cell} = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{nF} = \frac{-(-5.7 \times 10^4)}{1 \times 96500}$$

$$\boxed{E^\circ_{cell} = 5.9 \times 10^{-1}\ V}$$

### Q22.
Define adsorption with an example. Why is adsorption exothermic in nature? Write the types of adsorption based on the nature of forces between adsorbate and adsorbent.

**Answer:**

**Definition of Adsorption:**
The accumulation of molecular species at the surface rather than in the bulk of a solid or liquid is called **adsorption**.

**Example:** Water molecules adsorbed by silica gel.

**Why adsorption is exothermic:**
During the adsorption process, there is a force of attraction between the adsorbate and adsorbent. When these bonds form, energy is released. Hence adsorption is always **exothermic** in nature ($\Delta H < 0$).

**Types of Adsorption:**

| Type | Based on Force |
|------|---------------|
| **(a) Physisorption** | Weak van der Waals forces between adsorbate and adsorbent |
| **(b) Chemisorption** | Strong chemical (covalent/ionic) bonds between adsorbate and adsorbent |

### Q23. (Value-Based Question)
Seeing the growing cases of diabetes and depression among young children, Mr. Lugani, the principal of one reputed school organised a seminar in which he invited parents and principals. They all resolved this issue by strictly banning junk food in schools and introducing healthy snacks and drinks like soup, lassi, milk, etc. in school canteens. They also decided to make compulsory half an hour of daily physical activities for the students in the morning assembly. After six months, Mr. Lugani conducted the health survey in most of the schools and discovered a tremendous improvement in the health of the students.

After reading the above passage, answer the following questions:

(i) What are the values (at least two) displayed by Mr. Lugani?
(ii) As a student, how can you spread awareness about this issue?
(iii) What are antidepressant drugs? Give an example.
(iv) Name the sweetening agent used in the preparation of sweets for a diabetic patient.

**Answer:**

**(i)** Values displayed by Mr. Lugani:
- (a) He is very conscious towards the health of students.
- (b) He is very disciplined and proactive in addressing social issues.

**(ii)** As a student, I would motivate my friends and classmates to adopt healthy food habits, participate in physical activity, and avoid junk food. Awareness can be spread through school presentations, social media, and peer discussions.

**(iii)** **Antidepressant drugs** are chemical substances used to treat depression by inhibiting the enzymes that catalyse the degradation of neurotransmitters (e.g., norepinephrine and serotonin) in the brain.

**Example:** Phenelzine

**(iv)** **Saccharin** (ortho-sulphobenzimide) — it is 550 times sweeter than cane sugar and is excreted unchanged in urine, making it safe for diabetic patients.

### Q24.
For the hydrolysis of methyl acetate in aqueous solution, the following results were obtained:

| $t\ /\ s$ | 0 | 30 | 60 |
|-----------|---|----|----|
| $[CH_3COOCH_3]\ /\ mol\ L^{-1}$ | 0.60 | 0.30 | 0.15 |

(i) Show that it follows pseudo first order reaction, as the concentration of water remains constant.
(ii) Calculate the average rate of reaction between the time interval 30 to 60 seconds.

**OR**

(a) For a reaction $A + B \rightarrow P$, the rate is given by:
$$\text{Rate} = k[A]^2[B]$$

(i) How is the rate of reaction affected if the concentration of A is doubled?
(ii) What is the overall order of reaction if B is present in large excess?

(b) A first order reaction takes 23.1 minutes for 50% completion. Calculate the time required for 75% completion of this reaction.
(Given: $\log 2 = 0.301$, $\log 3 = 0.4771$, $\log 4 = 0.6021$)

**Answer:**

**(i) Proving Pseudo First Order:**

**Case 1** (at $t = 30\ s$):

$$K_1 = \frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{a}{a-x} = \frac{2.303}{30} \log \frac{0.60}{0.30}$$

$$\boxed{K_1 = \frac{2.303}{30} \log 2}$$

**Case 2** (at $t = 60\ s$):

$$K_2 = \frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{a}{a-x} = \frac{2.303}{60} \log \frac{0.60}{0.15}$$

$$K_2 = \frac{2.303}{60} \times 2\log 2$$

$$\boxed{K_2 = \frac{2.303}{30} \times \log 2}$$

Since $K_1 = K_2$, it confirms that the reaction follows **pseudo first order kinetics**.

**(ii) Average Rate between 30 s and 60 s:**

$$\text{Average rate} = -\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta t} = -\left(\frac{0.15 - 0.30}{60 - 30}\right)$$

$$= \frac{0.15}{30} = \frac{1}{200}$$

$$\boxed{= 5 \times 10^{-3}\ mol\ L^{-1}\ s^{-1}}$$

---

**OR**

**(a)(i)** When concentration of A is doubled:

$$\text{rate}_1 = k[A]^2[B]$$

$$\text{rate}_2 = k[2A]^2[B] = 4k[A]^2[B]$$

$$\boxed{r_2 = 4r_1}$$

The rate becomes **4 times** the original rate.

**(a)(ii)** If B is present in large excess, its concentration remains effectively constant. Therefore, the reaction is pseudo order with respect to A only:

$$\text{Overall order} = 2 \quad \text{(Second order w.r.t. A)}$$

**(b) For 50% completion** ($t_{1/2} = 23.1\ min$):

$$K = \frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{N_0}{N} = \frac{2.303}{23.1} \log \frac{100}{50}$$

$$K = \frac{2.303}{23.1} \log 2 \quad \cdots (1)$$

**For 75% completion** (25% remains):

$$K = \frac{2.303}{t} \log \frac{100}{25} = \frac{2.303}{t} \log 4 = \frac{2.303}{t} \times 2\log 2 \quad \cdots (2)$$

**Dividing equation (1) by equation (2):**

$$\frac{\dfrac{2.303}{23.1} \log 2}{\dfrac{2.303}{t} \times 2\log 2} = 1$$

$$\frac{t}{23.1 \times 2} = 1$$

$$\boxed{t = 46.2 \text{ minutes}}$$

### Q25.
(a) Account for the following:

(i) Bond angle in $NH_4^+$ is greater than that in $NH_3$.
(ii) Reducing character decreases from $SO_2$ to $TeO_2$.
(iii) $HClO_4$ is a stronger acid than $HClO$.

(b) Draw the structures of the following:

(i) $H_2S_2O_8$
(ii) $XeOF_4$

**OR**

(a) Which poisonous gas is evolved when white phosphorus is heated with conc. NaOH solution? Write the chemical equation.

(b) Write the formula of first noble gas compound prepared by N. Bartlett. What inspired N. Bartlett to prepare this compound?

(c) Fluorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine. Why?

(d) Write one use of chlorine gas.

(e) Complete the following equation: $CaF_2 + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

**(a)(i)** In both $NH_4^+$ and $NH_3$, nitrogen is $sp^3$ hybridised. However, in $NH_3$ there is one lone pair which causes lone pair–bond pair (lp–bp) repulsion, reducing the bond angle to $107°$. In $NH_4^+$, there is **no lone pair**, so only bp–bp repulsions exist, giving a bond angle of $109°28'$.

**(a)(ii)** Due to the **inert pair effect**, the stability of the +4 oxidation state increases down the group (S → Se → Te). $TeO_2$ has a more stable lower oxidation state and hence has less tendency to be oxidised further, making it a poor reducing agent. Therefore, reducing character decreases from $SO_2$ to $TeO_2$.

**(a)(iii)** In $HClO_4$, the oxidation state of Cl is $+7$, and in $HClO$ it is $+1$. Higher oxidation state and greater number of oxygen atoms in $HClO_4$ results in greater electron withdrawal from the O–H bond, making it easier to release $H^+$. Hence $HClO_4$ is a stronger acid.

**(b)(i) Structure of $H_2S_2O_8$ (Peroxodisulphuric acid / Marshall's acid):**

[Diagram: Two sulphur atoms each in tetrahedral geometry, connected via a peroxy ($-O-O-$) bridge. Each S has two $=O$ groups and one $-OH$ group. Structure:

$$HO - \overset{\displaystyle O}{\overset{\displaystyle \|}{S}} - O - O - \overset{\displaystyle O}{\overset{\displaystyle \|}{S}} - OH$$

with additional $=O$ on each S]

**(b)(ii) Structure of $XeOF_4$:**

[Diagram: Xe at centre with square pyramidal geometry. One $=O$ at apex, four F atoms in equatorial plane, one lone pair on Xe pointing downward (opposite to O). Shape is square pyramidal.]

---

**OR**

**(a)**

$$P_4 + 3NaOH + 3H_2O \longrightarrow PH_3 + 3NaH_2PO_2$$

**Poisonous gas:** $PH_3$ (Phosphine)

**(b)** Formula of first noble gas compound: $\mathbf{Xe^+PtF_6^-}$

N. Bartlett first prepared the compound $O_2^+PtF_6^-$. He then realised that the first ionisation enthalpy of molecular oxygen $(1175\ KJ\ mol^{-1})$ was almost identical with that of xenon $(1170\ KJ\ mol^{-1})$. This inspired him to make efforts to prepare a similar compound with Xe, and he successfully prepared the red-coloured compound $Xe^+PtF_6^-$.

**(c)** Fluorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine due to:
- **Low bond dissociation enthalpy** of $F-F$ bond (easily dissociates)
- **High hydration enthalpy** of $F^-$ ion

Both factors make the reduction of $F_2$ thermodynamically more favourable.

**(d)** Use of chlorine gas: **In sterilising/purifying drinking water.**

**(e)**

$$CaF_2 + H_2SO_4 \longrightarrow CaSO_4 + 2HF$$

(iii) $(CH_3CO)_2O\ /\ pyridine$

(b) Arrange the following in the increasing order of their boiling point:
$C_2H_5NH_2,\ C_2H_5OH,\ (CH_3)_3N$

(c) Give a simple chemical test to distinguish between the following pair of compounds:
$(CH_3)_2NH$ and $(CH_3)_3N$

**Answer:**

**Structures of A, B, C, D and E:**

- **A:** [Diagram: Benzamide — benzene ring with $-CO-NH_2$ group] i.e., $C_6H_5CONH_2$

- **Intermediate:** $C_6H_5NH_2$ (Aniline) — obtained by Hofmann bromamide degradation of A

- **B:** [Diagram: Benzene diazonium chloride — benzene ring with $-N_2^+Cl^-$] i.e., $C_6H_5N_2^+Cl^-$

- **C:** [Diagram: Benzonitrile — benzene ring with $-CN$ group] i.e., $C_6H_5CN$

- **D:** [Diagram: Phenyl isocyanide (carbylamine) — benzene ring with $-N\equiv C$] i.e., $C_6H_5NC$

- **E:** [Diagram: Benzoic acid — benzene ring with $-COOH$] i.e., $C_6H_5COOH$

**OR**

**(a)(i) Aniline + $Br_2$ water:**

[Diagram: Aniline] $+ 3Br_2 \xrightarrow{H_2O}$ [Diagram: 2,4,6-tribromoaniline — benzene ring with $-NH_2$ at position 1, $Br$ at positions 2, 4, and 6] $+ 3HBr$

**(a)(ii) Aniline + HCl:**

[Diagram: Aniline] $+ HCl \longrightarrow$ [Diagram: Anilinium chloride — $C_6H_5\overset{+}{N}H_3Cl^-$]

**(a)(iii) Aniline + $(CH_3CO)_2O$ / pyridine:**

[Diagram: Aniline] $+ (CH_3CO)_2O \xrightarrow{Py}$ [Diagram: Acetanilide — benzene ring with $-NH-CO-CH_3$]

**(b) Increasing order of boiling points:**

$$(CH_3)_3N < C_2H_5NH_2 < C_2H_5OH$$

**Reason:** Ethanol has the highest boiling point due to strong hydrogen bonding. Ethylamine forms hydrogen bonds but weaker than alcohol. Trimethylamine cannot form H-bonds (no N–H), so it has the lowest boiling point.

**(c) Chemical test to distinguish $(CH_3)_2NH$ and $(CH_3)_3N$:**

Use **Hinsberg's reagent** ($C_6H_5SO_2Cl$ — benzenesulphonyl chloride):

- $(CH_3)_2NH$ (secondary amine) **reacts** with Hinsberg's reagent to form a sulphonamide product (insoluble in NaOH):

$$(CH_3)_2NH + C_6H_5SO_2Cl \longrightarrow (CH_3)_2N - \underset{\displaystyle\|}{\overset{\displaystyle O}{\overset{\displaystyle\|}{S}}} - C_6H_5 + HCl$$

- $(CH_3)_3N$ (tertiary amine) **does not react** with Hinsberg's reagent (no N–H bond available).

This difference in reactivity with Hinsberg's reagent distinguishes the two compounds.
