## Section A — 1 mark each

> **Read the given passage and answer questions number 1 to 5 that follow:**
>
> The substitution reaction of alkyl halide mainly occurs by SN1 or SN2 mechanism. Whatever mechanism alkyl halides follow for the substitution reaction to occur, the polarity of the carbon halogen bond is responsible for these substitution reactions. The rate of SN1 reactions are governed by the stability of carbocation whereas for SN2 reactions steric factor is the deciding factor. If the starting material is a chiral compound, we may end up with an inverted product or racemic mixture depending upon the type of mechanism followed by alkyl halide. Cleavage of ethers with HI is also governed by steric factors and stability of carbocation, which indicates that in organic chemistry, these two major factors help us in deciding the kind of product formed.

---

### Q1.
Predict the stereochemistry of the product formed if an optically active alkyl halide undergoes substitution reaction by SN1 mechanism.

**Answer:** A **racemic mixture** is formed.

**Solution:** SN1 mechanism consists of two steps:
- **Step 1:** The C–X bond of the tertiary alkyl halide undergoes heterolysis to form a carbocation. The carbocation formed is **planar (sp² hybridised)**.
- **Step 2:** The nucleophile ($\text{Nu}^-$) can attack from **either face** of the planar carbocation with equal probability.

Thus, two products with **opposite spatial orientations** (+) and (−) are formed in equal amounts. Therefore, if the reactant is optically active, a **racemic mixture** (equal amounts of enantiomers) is produced, resulting in **zero optical rotation**.

---

### Q2.
Name the instrument used for measuring the angle by which the plane polarised light is rotated.

**Answer:** **Polarimeter**

**Solution:** A **polarimeter** is the instrument used for measuring the angle (called the angle of optical rotation) by which plane polarised light is rotated when it passes through an optically active substance.

---

### Q3.
Predict the major product formed when 2-Bromopentane reacts with alcoholic KOH.

**Answer:** **Pent-2-ene** (Saytzeff's product)

**Solution:** Alcoholic KOH acts as a base and promotes **elimination (E2)**. According to **Saytzeff's rule**, the more substituted alkene is the major product.

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH(Br)CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{KOH (alc.)}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH=CHCH}_2\text{CH}_3$$

The major product is **pent-2-ene**, which is more substituted (and hence more stable) than pent-1-ene.

---

### Q4.
Give one use of CHI₃.

**Answer:** CHI₃ (Iodoform) is used as an **antiseptic**.

**Solution:** Iodoform (CHI₃), also called triiodomethane, is a yellow crystalline solid belonging to the family of organic halogen compounds. It is used as an **antiseptic component of medications for minor skin diseases** due to its germicidal properties.

---

### Q5.
Write the structures of the products formed when anisole is treated with HI.

**Answer:** **Phenol** and **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)**

**Solution:** When anisole is treated with HI, the ether linkage is cleaved. Since the methyl group is less hindered, the iodide ion attacks the methyl carbon (SN2):

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OCH}_3 + \text{HI} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} + \text{CH}_3\text{I}$$

The products are **phenol** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH}$) and **iodomethane** ($\text{CH}_3\text{I}$).

---

### Q6.
Identify which liquid will have a higher vapour pressure at 90°C if the boiling points of two liquids A and B are 140°C and 180°C, respectively.

**Answer:** **Liquid A**

**Solution:** Liquid A has a **lower boiling point** (140°C), which means it has **weaker intermolecular forces** and hence a **higher tendency to vaporise**. At any given temperature below its boiling point (such as 90°C), liquid A will have a **higher vapour pressure** than liquid B.

---

### Q7.
Out of zinc and tin, whose coating is better to protect iron objects?

**Answer:** **Zinc**

**Solution:** **Zinc** coating (galvanisation) is better for protecting iron. Zinc is more **electropositive** (more reactive) than iron. Even if the zinc coating is broken or scratched, zinc acts as a **sacrificial anode** — it preferentially gets oxidised, thereby protecting the iron underneath. In contrast, tin (Sn) is less reactive than iron, so if the tin coating is broken, iron gets oxidised preferentially, accelerating corrosion.

---

### Q8.
Will the rate constant of the reaction depend upon temperature if the activation energy ($E_a$) of the reaction is zero?

**Answer:** **No**, the rate constant will **not** depend on temperature if $E_a = 0$.

**Solution:** According to the **Arrhenius equation**:

$$k = A \cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$$

If $E_a = 0$:

$$k = A \cdot e^{0} = A$$

The rate constant equals the pre-exponential factor $A$, which is **independent of temperature**. Hence, the rate constant does **not** depend on temperature when $E_a = 0$.

---

### Q9.
Give the structure of the monomer of PVC.

**Answer:** The monomer of PVC is **Vinyl Chloride (Chloroethene)**.

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Structure of vinyl chloride showing C=C double bond with H atoms on one carbon and H, Cl on the other carbon, polymerising to form PVC with repeating –CH₂–CHCl– units]

$$\underset{\text{Vinyl Chloride}}{\text{CH}_2\text{=CHCl}} \xrightarrow{\text{polymerisation}} \underset{\text{PVC}}{\left[-\text{CH}_2-\text{CHCl}-\right]_n}$$

The monomer is **chloroethene (vinyl chloride)**, $\text{CH}_2\text{=CHCl}$.

---

### Q10.
Which structural unit present in a detergent makes it non-biodegradable?

**Answer:** **Branching in the hydrocarbon (alkyl) chain** of detergents makes them non-biodegradable.

**Solution:** Detergents with **highly branched hydrocarbon chains** are resistant to microbial degradation because the microorganisms that break down organic matter cannot easily metabolise branched chains. Linear (straight-chain) alkyl groups are biodegradable, whereas **branched alkyl groups** are not.

### Q11.
Out of the following, the strongest base in aqueous solution is:

(a) Methylamine
(b) Dimethylamine
(c) Trimethylamine
(d) Aniline

**Answer:** **(a) Methylamine**

**Solution:** In aqueous solution, the basicity order of methylamines is influenced by two opposing effects — the **electron-donating inductive effect** of alkyl groups (which increases basicity) and the **steric effect** along with **solvation** (which decreases basicity for higher alkylamines). In aqueous solution, the order is:

$$\text{Dimethylamine} > \text{Methylamine} > \text{Trimethylamine} > \text{Aniline}$$

> **Note:** As per the answer key provided in this paper, methylamine is given as the answer. However, the standard accepted order in aqueous solution is dimethylamine > methylamine > trimethylamine > aniline. Aniline is definitely the weakest due to resonance delocalisation of the lone pair.

**Answer (as per paper):** **(a) Methylamine**

---

### Q12.
Iodoform test is not given by:

(a) Ethanal
(b) Ethanol
(c) Pentan-2-one
(d) Pentan-3-one

**Answer:** **(d) Pentan-3-one**

**Solution:** The **iodoform test** is given by compounds that have the structural unit $\text{CH}_3\text{CO–}$ (methyl ketone) or $\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)–}$ (secondary alcohol with methyl group). 

- **Ethanal** (CH₃CHO) ✓ — has CH₃CO– group  
- **Ethanol** (CH₃CH₂OH) ✓ — oxidised to ethanal first  
- **Pentan-2-one** (CH₃COCH₂CH₂CH₃) ✓ — has CH₃CO– group  
- **Pentan-3-one** (CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃) ✗ — does **not** have CH₃CO– group  

Therefore, **pentan-3-one** does **not** give the iodoform test.

---

### Q13.
Out of the following transition elements, the maximum number of oxidation states are shown by:

(a) Sc (Z = 21)
(b) Cr (Z = 24)
(c) Mn (Z = 25)
(d) Fe (Z = 26)

**Answer:** **(c) Mn (Z = 25)**

**Solution:** The number of oxidation states shown by transition metals depends on the number of unpaired electrons available. Mn (Z = 25) has the configuration $[\text{Ar}] 3d^5 4s^2$, giving it **5 unpaired 3d electrons + 2 electrons in 4s**, allowing it to exhibit oxidation states from **+2 to +7** — the **maximum range** among the listed elements.

| Element | Config. | Oxidation States |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Sc (Z=21) | [Ar] 3d¹4s² | +3 only |
| Cr (Z=24) | [Ar] 3d⁵4s¹ | +2, +3, +6 |
| **Mn (Z=25)** | **[Ar] 3d⁵4s²** | **+2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7** |
| Fe (Z=26) | [Ar] 3d⁶4s² | +2, +3 |

### Q14.
Hardening of leather in tanning industry is based on:

(a) Electrophoresis
(b) Electro-osmosis
(c) Mutual coagulation
(d) Tyndall effect

**Answer:** **(c) Mutual coagulation**

**Solution:** In tanning, **collagen fibres** of animal hide (which form a negatively charged colloidal sol) are treated with **tannin** (a positively charged colloidal sol derived from plants). The oppositely charged colloids neutralise each other and coagulate — a process called **mutual coagulation**. This precipitates and hardens the leather.

---

### Q15.
What is the correct IUPAC name of the given compound?

[Diagram: Structure showing a central carbon bonded to: CH₃ (top), H₃C (left), CH₂CH₃ (right), and COOH (bottom) — i.e., a carbon bearing two methyl groups, one ethyl group, and one carboxylic acid group]

(a) 2,2-Dimethyl butanoic acid
(b) 2-Carboxyl-2-methylbutane
(c) 2-Ethyl-2-methylpropanoic acid
(d) 3-Methylbutane carboxylic acid

**Answer:** **(a) 2,2-Dimethylbutanoic acid**

**Solution:** The structure is:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{-}\underset{|}{\overset{|}{\text{C}}}\text{(CH}_3\text{)(CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{)-COOH}$$

The longest carbon chain **including the –COOH group** has **4 carbons** (butanoic acid backbone). There are **two methyl groups** at position 2. Hence the IUPAC name is **2,2-dimethylbutanoic acid**.

---

> **For Questions 16 to 20, two statements are given — one labelled Assertion (A) and the other labelled Reason (R). Select the correct answer from the codes below:**
>
> **(i)** Both Assertion and Reason are correct, and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.
> **(ii)** Both Assertion and Reason are correct, but Reason is **not** the correct explanation for Assertion.
> **(iii)** Assertion is correct but Reason is incorrect.
> **(iv)** Both Assertion and Reason are incorrect.

### Q16.
**Assertion (A):** Au and Ag are extracted by leaching their ores with a dilute solution of NaCN.

**Reason (R):** Impurities associated with these ores dissolve in NaCN.

**Answer:** **(iii) Assertion is correct but Reason is incorrect.**

**Solution:** The **Assertion is correct** — gold and silver are indeed extracted by leaching with dilute NaCN solution (MacArthur–Forrest Cyanide Process). The ore is treated with dilute NaCN in the presence of air, forming soluble complexes:

$$4\text{Au} + 8\text{NaCN} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 4\text{Na}[\text{Au(CN)}_2] + 4\text{NaOH}$$

However, the **Reason is incorrect** — it is **not** the impurities that dissolve in NaCN; rather, it is the **gold/silver themselves** that dissolve in NaCN to form soluble complex ions. The impurities (gangue) do not dissolve.

---

### Q17.
**Assertion (A):** F–F bond in F₂ molecule is weak.

**Reason (R):** F atom is small.

**Answer:** **(iii) Assertion is correct but Reason is incorrect.**

**Solution:** The **Assertion is correct** — the F–F bond dissociation energy (~159 kJ/mol) is anomalously low compared to Cl–Cl (~242 kJ/mol) and Br–Br (~193 kJ/mol).

The **Reason is partially correct** in stating that F is small, but the complete and correct reason is: because of the **small size of the F atom**, the non-bonding lone pair electrons in the 2p orbitals are in close proximity, leading to **strong lone pair–lone pair repulsions** between the two F atoms. These repulsions weaken the F–F bond. The mere statement "F atom is small" is insufficient as a complete explanation, making the Reason as stated **incomplete/incorrect as a standalone reason**.

---

### Q18.
**Assertion (A):** Linkage isomerism arises in coordination compounds because of ambidentate ligands.

**Reason (R):** Ambidentate ligand like NO₂⁻ has two different donor atoms i.e., N and O.

**Answer:** **(i) Both Assertion and Reason are correct, and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

**Solution:** **Linkage isomerism** arises when an ambidentate ligand can coordinate to the metal through either of its two donor atoms, giving rise to isomers.

- $\text{NO}_2^-$ can bond through **N** (nitro, $-\text{NO}_2$) or through **O** (nitrito, $-\text{ONO}$).
- Similarly, $\text{SCN}^-$ can bond through **S** or **N**.

Since ambidentate ligands have two different donor atoms (as stated in the Reason), they give rise to linkage isomers. Hence, the **Reason correctly explains the Assertion**.

---

### Q19.
**Assertion (A):** Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar.

**Reason (R):** Sucrose has a glycosidic linkage.

**Answer:** **(i) Both Assertion and Reason are correct, and Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.**

**Solution:** **Sucrose** is a disaccharide composed of **α-D-glucose** and **β-D-fructose** joined by a **1,2-glycosidic linkage** (between C-1 of glucose and C-2 of fructose).

In this linkage, **both** the anomeric carbon of glucose (C-1, which normally forms the aldehyde) **and** the anomeric carbon of fructose (C-2, which normally forms the ketone) are involved in the glycosidic bond. Therefore, **neither free aldehyde nor free ketone group** is available, so sucrose **cannot reduce** Fehling's/Tollens' reagent — it is a **non-reducing sugar**. The glycosidic linkage (Reason) correctly explains why sucrose is non-reducing (Assertion).

---

### Q20.
**Assertion (A):** The molecularity of the reaction $\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr}$ appears to be 2.

**Reason (R):** Two molecules of the reactants are involved in the given elementary reaction.

**Answer:** **(ii) Both Assertion and Reason are correct, but Reason is not the correct explanation for Assertion.**

**Solution:** The **Assertion is correct** — from the stoichiometric equation, the molecularity *appears* to be 2 (one molecule of H₂ and one of Br₂). The **Reason is also correct** — two reactant molecules are involved.

However, the actual mechanism of $\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr}$ is a **chain reaction** (free radical mechanism) with multiple steps, and the **order of the reaction is 3/2**, not 2. **Molecularity** is defined only for elementary reactions, and this overall reaction is **not** an elementary reaction. Therefore, the Reason (though correct in stating two molecules are involved) does **not** correctly explain the Assertion — the Reason does not account for why the apparent molecularity differs from the true kinetics.

### Q21.
Define the following terms:

**(A) Tranquilizers**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** **Tranquilizers** are a class of chemical compounds (drugs) used for the treatment of **stress, anxiety, mild or severe mental diseases**. They act on the **central nervous system** to calm the patient without causing loss of consciousness. Examples include barbiturates (e.g., phenobarbitone), benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam/valium), and meprobamate.

**(B) Antiseptic**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** An **antiseptic** is a substance that either **inhibits the growth of** or **destroys microorganisms** (bacteria, fungi, viruses) when applied to **living tissues** such as wounds, cuts, and skin. Some antiseptics are **bactericidal** (kill microbes) while others are **bacteriostatic** (inhibit growth). Examples include dilute solutions of dettol, boric acid, iodoform (CHI₃), and hydrogen peroxide.

**OR**

### Q21 (OR).
Explain the cleansing action of soaps.

**Answer:**

**Solution:** The cleansing action of soaps is based on the **dual nature of soap molecules** — each molecule has:
- A **hydrophilic (water-loving) head** — the ionic carboxylate end ($-\text{COO}^-\text{Na}^+$)
- A **hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail** — the long hydrocarbon chain

**Mechanism:**
1. When soap is added to dirty water, the **hydrophobic tails** of soap molecules **embed themselves into the oily/greasy dirt**, while the **hydrophilic heads** remain directed **outward toward the water**.
2. This arrangement forms spherical clusters called **micelles**, with dirt trapped in the centre and ionic heads on the outer surface.
3. These micelles remain **dispersed in water** (forming a colloidal solution) because the negatively charged outer surface prevents them from coalescing.
4. When rinsed, the **dirt-containing micelles are washed away** with water, leaving the surface clean.

Soaps also **lower the surface tension** of water, allowing better wetting of the surface.

### Q22.
For 5% solution of urea (Molar mass = 60 g/mol), calculate the osmotic pressure at 300 K.
$\left[R = 0.0821 \text{ L atm K}^{-1}\text{mol}^{-1}\right]$

**Answer:** $\pi = 20.44 \text{ atm}$

**Solution:** A 5% solution of urea means **5 g of urea is present in 100 mL of solution**.

Given:
- $w = 5 \text{ g}$, $M = 60 \text{ g/mol}$, $V = 100 \text{ mL} = 0.1 \text{ L}$, $T = 300 \text{ K}$

**Step 1:** Calculate molarity (concentration):

$$C = \frac{w}{M \times V(\text{in L})} = \frac{5}{60 \times 0.1} = \frac{5}{6} = 0.833 \text{ mol/L}$$

**Step 2:** Apply the van't Hoff equation for osmotic pressure:

$$\pi = CRT$$

$$\pi = 0.833 \times 0.0821 \times 300$$

$$\boxed{\pi \approx 20.52 \text{ atm}}$$

(The paper gives $\approx 20.44$ atm using $C \approx 0.83$)

**OR**

### Q22 (OR).
Visha took two aqueous solutions — one containing 7.5 g of urea (Molar mass = 60 g/mol) and the other containing 42.75 g of substance Z in 100 g of water, respectively. It was observed that both the solutions froze at the same temperature. Calculate the molar mass of Z.

**Answer:** **Molar mass of Z = 342 g/mol**

**Solution:** Since both solutions freeze at the **same temperature**, they have the **same depression in freezing point** ($\Delta T_f$), and hence the same **molality**.

Given:
- Mass of solvent ($w_2$) = 100 g (same for both)
- Mass of urea ($w_1$) = 7.5 g, $M_1$ (urea) = 60 g/mol
- Mass of Z ($w_3$) = 42.75 g, $M_Z$ = ?

Since molalities are equal:

$$\frac{w_1 \times 1000}{M_1 \times w_2} = \frac{w_3 \times 1000}{M_Z \times w_2}$$

Since $w_2$ is the same and cancels:

$$\frac{w_1}{M_1} = \frac{w_3}{M_Z}$$

$$M_Z = \frac{w_3 \times M_1}{w_1} = \frac{42.75 \times 60}{7.5}$$

$$\boxed{M_Z = 342 \text{ g/mol}}$$

(This corresponds to the molar mass of **sucrose**, $\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{22}\text{O}_{11}$.)

### Q23.
Analyze the given graph, drawn between the concentration of reactant vs. time.

[Diagram: A graph with "Concentration of reactant" on the y-axis (values: 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2) and "Time" on the x-axis (values: 0, 10, 20, 30). The curve shows an exponential decay — the concentration halves every 10 units of time (constant half-life), showing: 1.6 → 0.8 → 0.4 → 0.2]

**(A) Predict the order of the reaction.**

**Answer:** **First-order reaction**

**Solution:** From the graph, the concentration of the reactant **halves at regular time intervals**:

$$1.6 \xrightarrow{t=10} 0.8 \xrightarrow{t=10} 0.4 \xrightarrow{t=10} 0.2$$

The **half-life is constant** (= 10 time units), which is a characteristic of a **first-order reaction**. The concentration also decreases **exponentially** with time, consistent with the first-order rate law:

$$[\text{A}] = [\text{A}]_0 \cdot e^{-kt}$$

**(B) Theoretically, can the concentration of the reactant reduce to zero after infinite time? Explain.**

**Answer:** **Yes**, theoretically the concentration can reduce to zero only after **infinite time**.

**Solution:** For a first-order reaction:

$$[\text{A}] = [\text{A}]_0 \cdot e^{-kt}$$

For $[\text{A}] = 0$, we need $e^{-kt} = 0$, which requires:

$$-kt \rightarrow -\infty \implies t \rightarrow \infty$$

Therefore, the concentration of the reactant approaches **zero asymptotically** — it can only theoretically become zero after **infinite time**. In practice, the concentration becomes negligibly small but never exactly zero in finite time.

### Q24.
Draw the shape of the following molecules:

**(A) XeOF₄**

**Answer:** **Square pyramidal**

**Solution:** In XeOF₄:
- Xe has 6 bond pairs (4 with F, 1 with O) + 1 lone pair = 7 electron pairs total
- Electron geometry: **Pentagonal bipyramidal** — actually: Xe has 8 electrons (valence), forms 4 Xe–F bonds and 1 Xe=O bond + 1 lone pair → total 6 electron domains → **octahedral** electron geometry

Correct analysis:
- Valence electrons on Xe = 8; used in 4 Xe–F bonds (4×2=8 electrons shared) + 1 Xe=O bond + 1 lone pair
- 6 electron domains around Xe → **octahedral arrangement** of electron domains
- With 1 lone pair and 1 double bond (O occupies 1 position), the **molecular shape is square pyramidal**

[Diagram: Xe at centre with 4 F atoms in a square plane, O atom above the plane (double bond), and 1 lone pair below the plane (axial). Shape is square pyramidal.]

**(B) BrF₃**

**Answer:** **T-shaped (bent T-shape)**

**Solution:** In BrF₃:
- Br has 7 valence electrons; 3 are used to form bonds with 3 F atoms → 2 lone pairs remain
- Total electron domains = 3 bond pairs + 2 lone pairs = 5 → **trigonal bipyramidal** electron geometry
- The 2 lone pairs occupy equatorial positions (to minimise repulsion)
- The 3 F atoms: 2 in equatorial and 1 in axial position → molecular shape is **T-shaped**

[Diagram: Br at centre with 2 lone pairs in the equatorial plane, 2 F atoms in equatorial positions, and 1 F atom in the axial position. The F–Br–F bond angles are slightly less than 90° due to lone pair repulsion. Shape is T-shaped.]

### Q25.
Give the formulae of the following compounds:

**(A) Potassium tetrahydroxidozincate(II)**

**Answer:**

$$\text{K}_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]$$

**Solution:** 
- Central metal: Zn in +2 oxidation state
- Ligand: OH⁻ (hydroxide), 4 ligands → tetrahydroxido
- Counter ion: K⁺, two needed to balance the −2 charge of the complex ion $[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]^{2-}$
- Formula: $\text{K}_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]$

**(B) Hexaammineplatinum(IV) chloride**

**Answer:**

$$[\text{Pt(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_4$$

**Solution:**
- Central metal: Pt in +4 oxidation state
- Ligand: NH₃ (ammine), 6 ligands → hexaammine
- Counter ion: Cl⁻, four needed to balance the +4 charge of the complex ion $[\text{Pt(NH}_3)_6]^{4+}$
- Formula: $[\text{Pt(NH}_3)_6]\text{Cl}_4$

### Q26.
What happens when:

**(A) Propanone is treated with methyl magnesium iodide and then hydrolyzed**

**Answer:** **tert-Butyl alcohol** is formed.

**Solution:** Methyl magnesium iodide (CH₃MgI) is a Grignard reagent. It acts as a nucleophile, and the carbanion (CH₃⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of propanone, followed by hydrolysis:

$$\underset{\text{Propanone}}{\text{CH}_3\text{–CO–CH}_3} + \text{CH}_3\text{MgI} \xrightarrow{\text{1. dry ether}} \xrightarrow{\text{2. H}_3\text{O}^+} \underset{\textit{tert}\text{-butyl alcohol}}{(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{C–OH}}$$

The Grignard reagent adds across the C=O bond to give a tertiary alcohol — **2-methylpropan-2-ol (tert-butyl alcohol)**.

**(B) Benzene is treated with CH₃COCl in the presence of anhydrous AlCl₃**

**Answer:** **Acetophenone** (methyl phenyl ketone) is formed.

**Solution:** This is a **Friedel–Crafts acylation** reaction. AlCl₃ acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, generating the acylium ion $\text{CH}_3\text{CO}^+$, which acts as the electrophile:

$$\underset{\text{Benzene}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_6} + \underset{\text{Acetyl chloride}}{\text{CH}_3\text{COCl}} \xrightarrow{\text{Anhydrous AlCl}_3} \underset{\text{Acetophenone}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COCH}_3} + \text{HCl}$$

### Q27.
Write the names and structures of monomers in the following polymers:

**(A) Bakelite**

**Answer:** Monomers are **Phenol** and **Formaldehyde**.

**Solution:** Bakelite is a **condensation polymer** (thermosetting polymer) formed by the condensation polymerisation of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of either an acid or base catalyst.

Structures of monomers:

[Diagram 1 — Phenol: Benzene ring with –OH group attached]

$$\underset{\text{Phenol}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH}} \quad \text{and} \quad \underset{\text{Formaldehyde}}{\text{HCHO}}$$

[Diagram 2 — Formaldehyde: H–CHO, i.e., H₂C=O]

**(B) Neoprene**

**Answer:** Monomer is **Chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene)**.

**Solution:** Neoprene is produced by the **addition (free radical) polymerisation** of chloroprene:

$$\underset{\text{Chloroprene (2-chlorobuta-1,3-diene)}}{\text{CH}_2\text{=CCl–CH=CH}_2} \xrightarrow{\text{polymerisation}} \underset{\text{Neoprene}}{\left[-\text{CH}_2\text{–CCl=CH–CH}_2\text{–}\right]_n}$$

### Q28.
Give the structures of A and B in the following sequence of reactions:

**(A)** $\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \xrightarrow{\text{NH}_3, \Delta} \text{A} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOBr}} \text{B}$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
- Step 1: Acetic acid reacts with NH₃ on heating to form **acetamide** (A):

$$\underset{\text{Acetic acid}}{\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}} \xrightarrow{\text{NH}_3, \Delta} \underset{(\text{A}) \text{ Acetamide}}{\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2}$$

**OR**

### Q28 (OR).

**(A) How will you distinguish between the following pairs of compounds?**

**(i) Aniline and Ethanamine**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Both can be distinguished by the **diazotisation and coupling test** (dye test):

Treat each with cold NaNO₂ + HCl (0–5°C), then add the solution to β-naphthol in NaOH:

- **Aniline** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$) forms a **stable diazonium salt** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^-$) which couples with β-naphthol to give a **bright orange-red azo dye**. ✓
- **Ethanamine** ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{NH}_2$) forms an **unstable aliphatic diazonium salt** that immediately decomposes to give nitrogen gas (effervescence) — **no azo dye** is formed. ✗

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{NaNO}_2/\text{HCl, }0\text{–}5°\text{C}} \underset{\text{stable}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^-} \xrightarrow{\beta\text{-naphthol/NaOH}} \text{Orange-red dye}$$

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{NH}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{NaNO}_2/\text{HCl}} \underset{\text{unstable}}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{N}_2^+\text{Cl}^-} \rightarrow \text{N}_2 \uparrow \text{ (no dye)}$$

---

**(ii) Aniline and N-methylaniline**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Both can be distinguished using the **carbylamine test** (isocyanide test) with CHCl₃ and KOH:

- **Aniline** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$) is a **primary amine** — it gives a **positive carbylamine test**, producing phenyl isocyanide ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NC}$), which has a **very offensive smell**. ✓

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + \text{CHCl}_3 + 3\text{KOH} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Phenyl isocyanide (foul smell)}}{\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NC}} + 3\text{KCl} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

- **N-methylaniline** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_4\text{–NH–CH}_3$) is a **secondary amine** — it does **not** give the carbylamine test. No foul smell. ✗

**(B) Arrange the following compounds in decreasing order of their boiling points: Butanol, Butanamine, Butane**

**Answer:** $\text{Butanol} > \text{Butanamine} > \text{Butane}$

**Solution:**
- **Butanol** forms **strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds** (O–H···O) due to high electronegativity of oxygen → **highest boiling point**
- **Butanamine** forms **weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonds** (N–H···N) than butanol (N is less electronegative than O) → intermediate boiling point
- **Butane** is a non-polar molecule with only **weak van der Waals forces** → **lowest boiling point**

$$\underset{117°\text{C}}{\text{Butanol}} > \underset{78°\text{C}}{\text{Butanamine}} > \underset{-1°\text{C}}{\text{Butane}}$$

### Q29.
Give the plausible explanation for the following:

**(A) Glucose doesn't give 2,4-DNP test.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** The **2,4-DNP test** (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine test) is given by compounds with a **free carbonyl group** (aldehydes and ketones). Although glucose contains an aldehyde group (–CHO), in solution it exists predominantly in the **cyclic hemiacetal form** (pyranose form), where the –CHO group is involved in **intramolecular hemiacetal formation** with the C-5 hydroxyl group. Since the free –CHO group is **not freely available**, glucose does **not** give the 2,4-DNP test.

**(B) The two strands of DNA are not identical but are complementary.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** The two strands of DNA are held together by **specific hydrogen bonding** between complementary nitrogenous bases according to **Chargaff's rules**:

- **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)** via **2 hydrogen bonds** (A=T)
- **Guanine (G)** pairs with **Cytosine (C)** via **3 hydrogen bonds** (G≡C)

This specific base-pairing means that wherever one strand has A, the other must have T, and wherever one has G, the other must have C. The sequences are therefore **complementary** (each strand dictates the sequence of the other) but **not identical** (they run antiparallel and have different base sequences).

**(C) Starch and cellulose both contain glucose units as monomers, yet they are structurally different.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Although both starch and cellulose are **polysaccharides of glucose**, they differ in the **type of glucose monomer** and **glycosidic linkage**:

| Property | Starch | Cellulose |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Monomer | **α-D-glucose** | **β-D-glucose** |
| Linkage | **α(1→4) glycosidic** bonds | **β(1→4) glycosidic** bonds |
| Structure | Helical (amylose) or branched (amylopectin) | Linear, unbranched fibres |

The difference in the **anomeric configuration** (α vs β) at C-1 of glucose leads to completely different three-dimensional structures and hence different physical and chemical properties.

### Q30.
Account for the following:

**(A) Sulphurous acid is a reducing agent.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** In sulphurous acid ($\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3$), sulphur is in the **+4 oxidation state**. Sulphur can readily get **further oxidised** to the **+6 oxidation state** (as in $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$) to achieve greater stability. Since sulphurous acid has the tendency to lose electrons (get oxidised), it acts as a **reducing agent**.

$$\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3 \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2e^- \quad (S: +4 \rightarrow +6)$$

**(B) Fluorine forms only one oxoacid.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Fluorine forms only **one oxoacid** — **hypofluorous acid (HOF)**. This is because:
1. Fluorine is the **most electronegative element** and has **no d-orbitals** in its valence shell (it is in Period 2).
2. The other halogens (Cl, Br, I) can form multiple oxoacids because they can **expand their octet** using available **d-orbitals** and use various oxidation states.
3. Fluorine, lacking d-orbitals, **cannot expand its octet** beyond 8 electrons, so it cannot form higher oxoacids like $\text{HXO}_2$, $\text{HXO}_3$, $\text{HXO}_4$.
4. Additionally, fluorine is not stable in positive oxidation states (it is always –1 in compounds), except in HOF where it is formally +1.

**(C) The boiling point of noble gases increases from He to Rn.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Noble gases are **monatomic** and the only intermolecular forces acting between their atoms are **weak London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces)**. The magnitude of these forces depends on the **polarisability** of the atoms, which in turn depends on the **atomic size** (number of electrons):

$$\text{He} < \text{Ne} < \text{Ar} < \text{Kr} < \text{Xe} < \text{Rn}$$

As we go from He to Rn:
- **Atomic size increases** (more electron shells)
- **Polarisability increases** (electron cloud is more easily distorted)
- **London dispersion forces increase**
- Therefore, **boiling points increase** progressively from He to Rn.

**OR**

### Q30 (OR).
Complete the following chemical reactions:

**(A)** $\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{HCl} \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

$$\text{MnO}_2 + 4\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MnCl}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Cl}_2$$

**Solution:** $\text{MnO}_2$ acts as an oxidising agent, oxidising $\text{HCl}$ to $\text{Cl}_2$. Mn is reduced from +4 to +2. This is the **laboratory method for preparation of chlorine**.

---

**(B)** $\text{XeF}_6 + \text{KF} \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

$$\text{XeF}_6 + \text{KF} \rightarrow \text{K}^+[\text{XeF}_7]^-$$

**Solution:** XeF₆ acts as a **Lewis acid** (fluoride ion acceptor), and KF provides the F⁻ ion. The product is potassium heptafluoroxenate(VI), $\text{K}^+[\text{XeF}_7]^-$.

---

**(C)** $\text{I}^-_{(\text{aq})} + \text{H}^+_{(\text{aq})} + \text{O}_{2(\text{g})} \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

$$4\text{I}^-_{(\text{aq})} + 4\text{H}^+_{(\text{aq})} + \text{O}_{2(\text{g})} \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(\text{l})} + 2\text{I}_{2(\text{s})}$$

**Solution:** In acidic solution, $\text{O}_2$ oxidises iodide ions ($\text{I}^-$) to iodine ($\text{I}_2$). Oxygen is reduced to water. The balanced equation shows 4 moles of I⁻ are oxidised per mole of O₂.

### Q31.
Explain the role of the following:

**(A) NaCN in the separation of ZnS and PbS**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** In the **froth flotation process**, when a mixture of ZnS and PbS ores is treated with NaCN, it acts as a **depressant (or selective inhibitor)** for ZnS.

- NaCN reacts with ZnS to form a soluble complex $[\text{Zn(CN)}_4]^{2-}$:
  $$\text{ZnS} + 4\text{NaCN} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2[\text{Zn(CN)}_4] + \text{Na}_2\text{S}$$
- This **prevents ZnS from being wetted by the froth**, so ZnS settles down.
- **PbS** is not complexed by NaCN and is selectively **carried up by the froth** and collected.
- Thus NaCN allows **selective separation** of PbS from ZnS.

**(B) SiO₂ in the metallurgy of Cu containing Fe as impurity**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** In the metallurgy of copper from copper pyrite ($\text{CuFeS}_2$), the iron present as impurity (FeO or $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ after roasting) reacts with $\text{SiO}_2$ (added as **flux**):

$$\text{FeO} + \text{SiO}_2 \rightarrow \underset{\text{Slag (iron silicate)}}{\text{FeSiO}_3}$$

$\text{SiO}_2$ is an **acidic flux** that combines with the basic iron oxide impurity to form **iron silicate (FeSiO₃) slag**, which is **immiscible with the molten copper matte** and can be easily skimmed off, thus removing the iron impurity.

**(C) Iodine in the refining of Ti**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Iodine is used in the **van Arkel method** (vapour phase refining) for the purification of Titanium:

**Step 1:** Impure Ti is heated with iodine to form a **volatile tetraiodide**:
$$\underset{\text{Impure}}{\text{Ti}} + 2\text{I}_2 \xrightarrow{250°\text{C}} \text{TiI}_4 \uparrow \text{ (volatile)}$$

**Step 2:** The volatile TiI₄ is then decomposed on a hot tungsten filament (at ~1400°C):
$$\text{TiI}_4 \xrightarrow{1400°\text{C (W filament)}} \underset{\text{Pure Ti}}{\text{Ti}} + 2\text{I}_2$$

The impurities are left behind (they don't form volatile iodides), and pure Ti is deposited on the filament. The regenerated I₂ is reused.

### Q32.
Give three points of difference between physisorption and chemisorption.

**Answer:**

| Sr. No. | **Physisorption** | **Chemisorption** |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1. | Caused by **weak van der Waals forces** between adsorbate and adsorbent. | Caused by **strong chemical bonds** (covalent or ionic) between adsorbate and adsorbent. |
| 2. | **Reversible** in nature — adsorbate can be easily removed by decreasing pressure or increasing temperature. | **Irreversible** in nature — adsorbate is strongly bound and cannot be easily removed. |
| 3. | **Low enthalpy of adsorption** (~20–40 kJ/mol); not very specific. | **High enthalpy of adsorption** (~40–400 kJ/mol); highly **specific** in nature. |
| 4. | Occurs at **low temperatures**; decreases with increasing temperature. | Increases with temperature up to a certain point; requires **activation energy**. |
| 5. | Results in the formation of **multimolecular layers**. | Results in formation of only a **monomolecular layer**. |

*(Any three differences are acceptable.)*

### Q33.
How will the rate of the reaction be affected when:

**(A) Surface area of the reactant is reduced**

**Answer:** Rate of reaction **decreases**.

**Solution:** For heterogeneous reactions (reactions involving solids/liquids), the reaction occurs at the surface of the reactant. When the **surface area is reduced** (e.g., using larger lumps instead of a powder), fewer reactant molecules are exposed and available for collision. Hence, the **frequency of effective collisions decreases**, leading to a **decrease in the rate of reaction**.

**(B) Catalyst is added in a reversible reaction**

**Answer:** Rate of reaction **increases** (for both forward and backward reactions).

**Solution:** A **catalyst** provides an **alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy** ($E_a$). This allows a greater fraction of reactant molecules to possess sufficient energy to react, increasing the **frequency of effective collisions**. Therefore, the rate of reaction **increases**. Note: for a reversible reaction, a catalyst increases the rates of **both forward and reverse reactions equally**, so it does not change the **equilibrium position** — equilibrium is reached **faster**.

**(C) Temperature of the reaction is increased**

**Answer:** Rate of reaction **increases**.

**Solution:** According to the **Arrhenius equation**:

$$k = A \cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$$

When temperature increases:
1. The **kinetic energy of molecules increases**, so more molecules possess energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.
2. The **frequency of effective collisions increases**.
3. The rate constant $k$ increases (roughly **doubles for every 10°C rise** for many reactions).

Therefore, increasing temperature **increases the rate of reaction**.

### Q34.
Calculate the mass of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, $\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\text{O}_6$) to be dissolved in 75 g of acetic acid to lower its melting point by 1.5°C.
$\left[K_f = 3.9 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1}\right]$

**Answer:** **Mass of ascorbic acid = 5.08 g**

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate molar mass of ascorbic acid ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\text{O}_6$):**

$$M_2 = (6 \times 12) + (8 \times 1) + (6 \times 16) = 72 + 8 + 96 = 176 \text{ g/mol}$$

**Step 2: Use the freezing point depression formula:**

$$\Delta T_f = K_f \times m = K_f \times \frac{w_2 \times 1000}{M_2 \times w_1}$$

Where:
- $\Delta T_f = 1.5°\text{C}$ (depression in melting/freezing point)
- $K_f = 3.9 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1}$
- $M_2 = 176 \text{ g/mol}$ (molar mass of ascorbic acid)
- $w_1 = 75 \text{ g}$ (mass of acetic acid, the solvent)
- $w_2 = ?$ (mass of ascorbic acid, the solute)

**Step 3: Rearrange and solve for $w_2$:**

$$w_2 = \frac{\Delta T_f \times M_2 \times w_1}{K_f \times 1000}$$

$$w_2 = \frac{1.5 \times 176 \times 75}{3.9 \times 1000}$$

$$w_2 = \frac{19800}{3900}$$

$$\boxed{w_2 = 5.08 \text{ g}}$$

Therefore, **5.08 g** of ascorbic acid must be dissolved in 75 g of acetic acid to lower its melting point by 1.5°C.

## Section D — 5 marks each

### Q35.

**(A) Calculate $\Delta G^0$ for the reaction:**

$$\text{Zn}_{(s)} + \text{Cu}^{2+}_{(aq)} = \text{Zn}^{2+}_{(aq)} + \text{Cu}_{(s)}$$

Given: $E^0$ for $\dfrac{\text{Zn}^{2+}}{\text{Zn}} = -0.76\text{ V}$ and $E^0$ for $\dfrac{\text{Cu}^{2+}}{\text{Cu}} = +0.34\text{ V}$

$R = 8.314 \text{ J K}^{-1}\text{mol}^{-1}$ and $F = 96500 \text{ C mol}^{-1}$

**Answer:** $\Delta G^0 = -212300 \text{ J/mol} = -212.3 \text{ kJ/mol}$

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Identify anode and cathode:**
- **Anode (oxidation):** Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻, $E^0_{\text{anode}} = -0.76\text{ V}$
- **Cathode (reduction):** Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu, $E^0_{\text{cathode}} = +0.34\text{ V}$

**Step 2: Calculate $E^0_\text{cell}$:**

$$E^0_\text{cell} = E^0_\text{cathode} - E^0_\text{anode} = +0.34 - (-0.76) = +1.10 \text{ V}$$

**Step 3: Calculate $\Delta G^0$:**

$$\Delta G^0 = -nFE^0_\text{cell}$$

Where $n = 2$ (2 electrons transferred):

$$\Delta G^0 = -2 \times 96500 \times 1.10$$

$$\Delta G^0 = -212300 \text{ J mol}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{\Delta G^0 = -212.3 \text{ kJ mol}^{-1}}$$

The negative value confirms the reaction is **spontaneous**.

**(B) Give two advantages of fuel cells.**

**Answer:**

**Solution:** Advantages of fuel cells:

1. **High efficiency:** Fuel cells convert chemical energy of fuels (like H₂) directly into electrical energy with **higher efficiency (~70%)** compared to conventional thermal power plants (~40%), as they are not limited by the Carnot cycle.

2. **Less pollution:** Fuel cells produce **water** as the only byproduct (when H₂ is used as fuel), causing **negligible exhaust pollution** compared to combustion engines, making them environmentally friendly.

3. *(Additional advantage)* Fuel cells operate **continuously** as long as fuel is supplied, without requiring recharging like conventional batteries.

**OR**

### Q35 (OR).

**(A) Out of the following pairs, predict with reason which pair will allow greater conduction of electricity:**

**(i) Silver wire at 30°C or silver wire at 60°C**

**Answer:** **Silver wire at 30°C** has greater electrical conductance.

**Solution:** Silver is a **metallic conductor**. In metallic conductors, conduction occurs through the movement of free electrons. As **temperature increases**, the positive metal ions vibrate more intensely, causing greater **resistance to electron flow** (more collisions between electrons and ions). Therefore:
- Higher temperature → Higher resistance → **Lower conductance**
- Silver wire at **30°C** has lower resistance and thus **greater conductance** than at 60°C.

---

**(ii) 0.1 M CH₃COOH solution or 1 M CH₃COOH solution**

**Answer:** **0.1 M CH₃COOH** has greater electrical conductance.

**Solution:** CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a **weak electrolyte** that partially ionises. The **degree of ionisation** ($\alpha$) is inversely related to concentration (Ostwald's dilution law):

$$\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{K_a}{C}}$$

At **lower concentration (0.1 M)**, the degree of ionisation is **higher**, meaning more ions (H⁺ and CH₃COO⁻) are present in solution. More ions → greater ionic mobility → **greater conductance**.

Thus, **0.1 M CH₃COOH** solution has greater conductance than 1 M CH₃COOH.

---

**(iii) KCl solution at 20°C or KCl solution at 50°C**

**Answer:** **KCl solution at 50°C** has greater electrical conductance.

**Solution:** KCl is a **strong electrolyte** (ionic conductor in solution). Unlike metallic conductors, the conductance of **electrolytic solutions increases with temperature** because:
- Higher temperature → **lower viscosity** of solution → **greater ionic mobility** (ions move faster)
- More effective ionic migration → **greater conductance**

Therefore, **KCl solution at 50°C** has greater conductance than at 20°C.

**(B) Give two points of difference between electrochemical and electrolytic cells.**

**Answer:**

| 2. Electrode polarity | **Anode is negative** (–); **Cathode is positive** (+). | **Anode is positive** (+); **Cathode is negative** (–). |
| 3. Spontaneity | Reaction is **spontaneous** ($\Delta G < 0$). | Reaction is **non-spontaneous** ($\Delta G > 0$). |
