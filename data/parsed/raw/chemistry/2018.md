## Section A — 1 Mark Each

### Q1.
Write the IUPAC name of the following compound:

[Diagram: A branched alcohol structure with a central carbon bearing a CH₃ group (above), an ethyl group (C₂H₅, below-left), connected to a CH group bearing an OH group, which is connected to a terminal CH₃]

$$\text{CH}_3 - \overset{\displaystyle\text{CH}_3\atop|}{\text{C}} - \overset{\displaystyle\text{OH}\atop|}{\text{CH}} - \text{CH}_3$$

with a $\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$ group attached below the central carbon.

**Answer:** 3,3-dimethylpentan-2-ol

**Solution:**
Numbering the longest carbon chain (5 carbons = pentane):

$$\underset{5}{\text{CH}_3} - \underset{4}{\text{CH}_2} - \overset{3}{\overset{\displaystyle\text{CH}_3\atop|}{\text{C}}} - \overset{2}{\overset{\displaystyle\text{OH}\atop|}{\text{CH}}} - \overset{1}{\text{CH}_3}$$

- Parent chain: pentane (5 carbons)
- OH group at C-2 → pentan-2-ol
- Two CH₃ groups at C-3 → 3,3-dimethyl

**IUPAC Name: 3,3-dimethylpentan-2-ol**

### Q2.
Out of chlorobenzene and benzyl chloride, which one gets easily hydrolysed by aqueous NaOH and why?

**Answer:** Benzyl chloride gets easily hydrolysed.

**Solution:** Benzyl chloride will get easily hydrolysed because the halogen (Cl) is attached to a primary (1°) sp³ carbon atom, making it susceptible to nucleophilic substitution. In chlorobenzene, the C–Cl bond has partial double bond character due to resonance between the lone pair of Cl and the aromatic ring, making hydrolysis very difficult.

---

### Q3.
CO(g) and H₂(g) react to give different products in the presence of different catalysts. Which ability of the catalyst is shown by these reactions?

**Answer:** This ability is known as **catalytic selectivity**.

**Solution:** Catalytic selectivity is the ability of a catalyst to direct a reaction to give a particular product from among several possible products. It implies that the catalyst participates in the reaction pathway and controls which product is formed. For example:
- With Co catalyst: CO + H₂ → hydrocarbons (Fischer-Tropsch)
- With different catalysts: CO + H₂ → methanol, etc.

### Q4.
Write the coordination number and oxidation state of Platinum in the complex $\left[\text{Pt(en)}_2\text{Cl}_2\right]$.

**Answer:**
- **Coordination Number** = 6
- **Oxidation State** = +2

**Solution:**
- "en" (ethylenediamine) is a **bidentate** ligand → each en occupies 2 coordination sites
- 2 en ligands → $2 \times 2 = 4$ coordinate bonds
- 2 Cl⁻ ligands → $2 \times 1 = 2$ coordinate bonds
- Total coordination number = $4 + 2 = \mathbf{6}$

For oxidation state, let oxidation state of Pt = $x$:
$$x + 2(0) + 2(-1) = 0 \implies x = +2$$

### Q5.
Analysis shows that FeO has a non-stoichiometric composition with formula $\text{Fe}_{0.95}\text{O}$. Give reason.

**Answer:**

**Solution:** In $\text{Fe}_{0.95}\text{O}$, some Fe²⁺ sites in the crystal lattice are replaced by Fe³⁺ ions. To maintain electrical neutrality, for every 3 Fe²⁺ ions replaced by 2 Fe³⁺ ions, one cation site becomes vacant. This **metal deficiency defect** (a type of non-stoichiometric defect) results in a compound where the ratio of Fe to O is less than 1:1. Because it is a defect structure and not a simple interstitial compound, it does not follow a fixed stoichiometric composition.

---

### Q6.
Complete and balance the following chemical equations:

**(a)** $\text{Fe}^{2+} + \text{MnO}_4^- + \text{H}^+ \longrightarrow$

**(b)** $\text{MnO}_4^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{I}^- \longrightarrow$

**Answer:**

**(a)**
$$5\text{Fe}^{2+} + 2\text{MnO}_4^- + 8\text{H}^+ \longrightarrow 5\text{Fe}^{3+} + 2\text{Mn}^{2+} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**(b)**
$$2\text{MnO}_4^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{I}^- \longrightarrow 2\text{MnO}_2 + 2\text{OH}^- + \text{IO}_3^-$$

---

### Q7.
How do you convert the following?

**(a) Ethanal to Propanone**

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{PCC}} \text{CH}_3\text{CHO}$$

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{1.\ \text{CH}_3\text{MgBr};\ 2.\ \text{H}_3\text{O}^+} \text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_3$$

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{PCC}} \text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3\ \text{(Propanone)}$$

**(b) Toluene to Benzoic acid**

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{K}_2\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7/\text{H}^+} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{COOH}$$

[Diagram: Toluene (benzene ring with –CH₃ group) oxidized by K₂Cr₂O₇/H⁺ to give Benzoic acid (benzene ring with –COOH group)]

---

**OR**

Account for the following:

**(a) Aromatic carboxylic acids do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.**

**Answer/Solution:** The –COOH group is a strong electron-withdrawing group that shows a **–M (mesomeric) effect**. It withdraws electron density from the aromatic ring, making it electron-deficient and **deactivated** towards electrophilic substitution reactions (such as Friedel-Crafts). Since Friedel-Crafts reaction requires an electron-rich aromatic ring, aromatic carboxylic acids do not undergo this reaction.

---

**(b) $\text{pK}_a$ value of 4-nitrobenzoic acid is lower than that of benzoic acid.**

**Answer/Solution:** The –NO₂ group at the para position is strongly electron-withdrawing in nature (both –I and –M effects). This withdrawing effect increases the polarity of the O–H bond in the –COOH group, making it easier to release the proton (H⁺). As acidity increases, $\text{pK}_a$ decreases. Therefore, 4-nitrobenzoic acid is a stronger acid than benzoic acid and has a **lower** $\text{pK}_a$ value.

---

### Q8.
For the reaction:

$$2\text{N}_2\text{O}_5(g) \longrightarrow 4\text{NO}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g)$$

the rate of formation of NO₂(g) is $2.8 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$. Calculate the rate of disappearance of $\text{N}_2\text{O}_5(g)$.

**Answer:** Rate of disappearance of $\text{N}_2\text{O}_5 = 1.4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$

**Solution:**

The rate of reaction is expressed as:

$$\text{Rate} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d[\text{N}_2\text{O}_5]}{dt} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{d[\text{NO}_2]}{dt} = \frac{d[\text{O}_2]}{dt}$$

Given:
$$\frac{d[\text{NO}_2]}{dt} = 2.8 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$$

Therefore:
$$-\frac{d[\text{N}_2\text{O}_5]}{dt} = \frac{2}{4}\frac{d[\text{NO}_2]}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2.8 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{-\frac{d[\text{N}_2\text{O}_5]}{dt} = 1.4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}}$$

### Q9.
Among the hydrides of Group-15 elements, which have the:

**(a)** Lowest boiling point?

**(b)** Maximum basic character?

**(c)** Highest bond angle?

**(d)** Maximum reducing character?

**Answer:**

**(a)** Lowest boiling point = **PH₃**

**Solution:** NH₃ has an anomalously high boiling point due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Among the rest, PH₃ has the lowest boiling point as it has the weakest van der Waals forces.

**(b)** Maximum basic character = **NH₃**

**Solution:** As we go down Group 15, the size of the central atom increases, lone pair becomes less available for donation (more diffuse), so basic character decreases: $\text{NH}_3 > \text{PH}_3 > \text{AsH}_3 > \text{SbH}_3 > \text{BiH}_3$.

**(c)** Highest bond angle = **NH₃** ($107.8°$)

**Solution:** In NH₃, the N atom is small and highly electronegative, so the bonding pairs are closer to N, causing greater bp–bp repulsion and a larger bond angle compared to heavier hydrides.

**(d)** Maximum reducing character = **BiH₃**

**Solution:** Reducing character of hydrides increases down the group as the E–H bond strength decreases. Hence BiH₃ has the maximum reducing character.

### Q10.
Calculate the freezing point of a solution containing 60 g of glucose (Molar mass = 180 g mol⁻¹) in 250 g of water.
($K_f$ of water = 1.86 K kg mol⁻¹)

**Answer:** Freezing point = **270.53 K**

**Solution:**

Using the formula:
$$\Delta T_f = K_f \times m$$

Moles of glucose:
$$n = \frac{60}{180} = \frac{1}{3}\ \text{mol}$$

Molality:
$$m = \frac{n}{\text{mass of solvent (kg)}} = \frac{60/180}{0.250} = \frac{0.333}{0.250} = 1.33\ \text{mol kg}^{-1}$$

Depression in freezing point:
$$\Delta T_f = 1.86 \times 1.33 = 2.4738\ \text{K}$$

Since:
$$T_f^\circ - T_f = \Delta T_f$$
$$T_f = T_f^\circ - \Delta T_f = 273 - 2.4738$$

$$\boxed{T_f = 270.53\ \text{K}}$$

---

### Q11.
An element 'X' (At. mass = 40 g mol⁻¹) having f.c.c. structure has unit cell edge length of 400 pm. Calculate the density of 'X' and the number of unit cells in 4 g of 'X'.
($N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\ \text{mol}^{-1}$)

**Answer:**
- Density = $4.1514\ \text{g cm}^{-3}$
- Number of unit cells = $1.5 \times 10^{22}$

**Solution:**

**Density:**

For FCC, $Z = 4$

$$d = \frac{Z \times M}{N_A \times a^3}$$

$$d = \frac{4 \times 40}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times (400 \times 10^{-10})^3}$$

$$d = \frac{160}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 64 \times 10^{-24}}$$

$$\boxed{d = 4.1514\ \text{g cm}^{-3}}$$

**Number of unit cells in 4 g:**

Volume of 4 g of X:
$$V = \frac{4}{4.1514} = 0.96\ \text{cm}^3$$

Volume of one unit cell:
$$v = (400 \times 10^{-10})^3 = 64 \times 10^{-24}\ \text{cm}^3$$

Number of unit cells:
$$= \frac{0.96}{64 \times 10^{-24}} = \boxed{1.5 \times 10^{22}}$$

---

### Q12.
Give reasons for the following:

**(a) Measurement of osmotic pressure method is preferred for the determination of molar masses of macromolecules such as proteins and polymers.**

**Answer/Solution:** The osmotic pressure method is preferred because:
- Pressure measurement is carried out at **room temperature**, so there is no risk of degradation of heat-sensitive macromolecules.
- **Molarity** of the solution is used instead of molality, which is easier to measure for solutions of large molecules.
- The magnitude of osmotic pressure is **very large** even for very dilute solutions of macromolecules (compared to other colligative properties like elevation in boiling point or depression in freezing point), making it easier to measure accurately.

---

**(b) Aquatic animals are more comfortable in cold water than in warm water.**

**Answer/Solution:** The solubility of gases in liquids **decreases with increase in temperature** (Henry's Law). In cold water, more oxygen (O₂) is dissolved compared to warm water. Since aquatic animals breathe dissolved oxygen, they are more comfortable in cold water where the oxygen concentration is higher.

---

**(c) Elevation of boiling point of 1 M KCl solution is nearly double than that of 1 M sugar solution.**

**Answer/Solution:** Elevation in boiling point is a **colligative property** — it depends only on the number of solute particles, not their nature.

- Sugar (non-electrolyte): 1 M sugar gives **1 mol** of particles per litre.
- KCl (electrolyte): 1 M KCl dissociates as $\text{KCl} \rightarrow \text{K}^+ + \text{Cl}^-$, giving approximately **2 mol** of particles per litre.

Since KCl produces nearly double the number of particles compared to sugar, the elevation in boiling point of 1 M KCl is nearly **double** that of 1 M sugar solution.

---

### Q13.
Write the structures of the main products in the following reactions:

**(i)**

$$\underset{\text{(cyclohexanone ring with –CH₂–C(=O)–OCH₃ substituent)}}{\text{}} \xrightarrow{\text{NaBH}_4}$$

[Diagram: Cyclohexanone ring with a –CH₂–C(=O)–OCH₃ side chain reacting with NaBH₄]

**Answer/Solution:** NaBH₄ is a **mild reducing agent** that selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes but **not esters**. Therefore, only the ketone (cyclohexanone) carbonyl is reduced to an alcohol; the ester group (–C(=O)–OCH₃) remains unchanged.

[Diagram: Product is a cyclohexanol ring (with –OH) bearing the unchanged –CH₂–C(=O)–OCH₃ side chain]

$$\text{Cyclohexanone part} \xrightarrow{\text{NaBH}_4} \text{Cyclohexanol part (–OH formed), ester group intact}$$

---

**(ii)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–CH=CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+} ?$$

**Answer/Solution:** This follows **Markovnikov's rule** — the OH adds to the more substituted carbon (the carbon attached to the benzene ring), forming a secondary alcohol:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–CH=CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–CH(OH)–CH}_3$$

[Diagram: Styrene reacts with water in presence of H⁺ to give 1-phenylethan-1-ol]

---

**(iii)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–OC}_2\text{H}_5 + \text{HI} \longrightarrow ?$$

**Answer/Solution:** When phenyl ethyl ether reacts with HI, the C–O bond on the **alkyl side** is cleaved (since phenol C–O bond is stronger due to resonance). The products are phenol and ethyl iodide:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–OC}_2\text{H}_5 + \text{HI} \longrightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} + \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{I}$$

[Diagram: Phenetole (ethoxybenzene) + HI → Phenol + Iodoethane]

---

### Q14.

**(a) Write the formula of the following coordination compound:**

Iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II)

**Answer:**
$$\text{Fe}_4\left[\text{Fe(CN)}_6\right]_3$$

**Solution:**
- Iron(III) = Fe³⁺ (outside the coordination sphere, 4 of them)
- Hexacyanoferrate(II) = $[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}$ (3 of them)
- $4 \times (+3) + 3 \times (-4) = +12 - 12 = 0$ ✓ (electrically neutral)

---

**(b) What type of isomerism is exhibited by the complex $\left[\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}\right]\text{SO}_4$?**

**Answer:** **Ionisation isomerism**

**Solution:** The complex $[\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{SO}_4$ and its ionisation isomer $[\text{Co(NH}_3)_5\text{SO}_4]\text{Cl}$ differ in the ions produced in solution — SO₄²⁻ or Cl⁻ can be present inside or outside the coordination sphere. This is ionisation isomerism.

---

**(c) Write the hybridisation and number of unpaired electrons in the complex $\left[\text{CoF}_6\right]^{3-}$.**
(Atomic No. of Co = 27)

**Answer:**
- Hybridisation: $sp^3d^2$
- Number of unpaired electrons: **4**

**Solution:**
- Co has atomic number 27; configuration: [Ar] 3d⁷ 4s²
- In $[\text{CoF}_6]^{3-}$, Co is in +3 oxidation state: Co³⁺ configuration = 3d⁶
- F⁻ is a **weak field ligand** → does **not** cause pairing of electrons
- 3d⁶ with weak field: $t_{2g}^4\ e_g^2$ → **4 unpaired electrons**
- Hybridisation: outer d orbitals (4d) are used → $sp^3d^2$ (outer orbital complex)

### Q15.
(A), (B) and (C) are three non-cyclic functional isomers of a carbonyl compound with molecular formula $\text{C}_4\text{H}_8\text{O}$. Isomers (A) and (C) give positive Tollen's test whereas isomer (B) does not give Tollen's test but gives positive Iodoform test. Isomers (A) and (B) on reduction with Zn(Hg)/conc. HCl give the same product (D).

**(a) Write the structures of (A), (B), (C) and (D).**

**Answer:**

**(A):** $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CHO}$ (Butanal)

**(B):**
$$\text{CH}_3 - \overset{\displaystyle\text{O}\atop\|}{C} - \text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3 \quad \text{(Butanone / Methyl ethyl ketone)}$$

**(C):**
$$\text{CH}_3 - \overset{\displaystyle\text{CH}_3\atop|}{\text{CH}} - \overset{\displaystyle\text{O}\atop\|}{\text{C}} - \text{H} \quad \text{(2-methylpropanal)}$$

**(D):** $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3$ (Butane)

**Solution:**
- Tollen's test positive → aldehydes → (A) and (C) are aldehydes
- Iodoform test positive for (B), no Tollen's → (B) is a methyl ketone (butanone, CH₃COCH₂CH₃)
- (A) and (B) give the same product (D) on Clemmensen reduction → both give butane
  - (A) = butanal → reduction → butane ✓
  - (B) = butanone → reduction → butane ✓
- (C) is the other aldehyde isomer = 2-methylpropanal

---

**(b) Out of (A), (B) and (C) isomers, which one is least reactive towards addition of HCN?**

**Answer:** **(B)** is the least reactive.

**Solution:** HCN addition is a **nucleophilic addition** reaction. Ketones are less reactive than aldehydes towards nucleophilic addition because:
1. The two alkyl groups in ketones are electron-donating (inductive effect), reducing the partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon.
2. Steric hindrance is greater in ketones (two alkyl groups vs. one H in aldehydes).

Therefore, (B) — a ketone — is the least reactive towards HCN addition.

---

### Q16.

**(a) Identify the chiral molecule in the following pair:**

[Diagram: (i) A cyclohexane ring with an –OH substituent at a carbon that also bears two different carbon substituents (making it chiral); (ii) A symmetric cyclohexane ring with –OH where the two substituents on the OH-bearing carbon are identical]

**Answer:** Molecule **(i)** is the chiral molecule.

**Solution:** In molecule (i), the carbon bearing the –OH group is attached to **four different groups** (it is a chiral/asymmetric carbon, marked with *). In molecule (ii), the carbon bearing –OH has two identical substituents (the molecule has a plane of symmetry), so it is **achiral** (a meso-type compound or has an internal plane of symmetry).

---

**(b) Write the structure of the product when chlorobenzene is treated with methyl chloride in the presence of sodium metal and dry ether.**

**Answer:** This is the **Wurtz-Fittig reaction**.

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{Cl} + 2\text{Na} + \text{ClCH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{dry ether}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_3 + 2\text{NaCl}$$

[Diagram: Chlorobenzene + methyl chloride + 2Na → Toluene (methylbenzene) + 2NaCl]

Product = **Toluene** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{CH}_3$)

---

**(c) Write the structure of the alkene formed by dehydrohalogenation of 1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane with alcoholic KOH.**

**Answer:**

$$\text{1-bromo-1-methylcyclohexane} \xrightarrow{\text{alc. KOH}} \text{1-methylcyclohex-1-ene}$$

[Diagram: Cyclohexane ring bearing both –Br and –CH₃ at position 1 loses HBr with alc. KOH to form a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at C1 and a –CH₃ group at C1 (methylenecyclohexane/1-methylcyclohexene)]

Product: **1-methylcyclohex-1-ene** (by Zaitsev's rule, more substituted alkene is the major product)

### Q17.
Give reasons:

**(a) E° value for Mn³⁺/Mn²⁺ couple is much more positive than that for Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺.**

**Answer/Solution:**

- For $\text{Mn}^{3+}/\text{Mn}^{2+}$: The standard reduction potential is large and positive because Mn³⁺ is easily reduced to Mn²⁺. Mn²⁺ has a **half-filled d-orbital** (3d⁵), which is an extra stable configuration. Therefore, Mn³⁺ has a strong tendency to get reduced to the stable Mn²⁺ → large positive $E°$.

- For $\text{Fe}^{3+}/\text{Fe}^{2+}$: Fe³⁺ has a **half-filled d-orbital** (3d⁵) configuration, making Fe³⁺ itself the more stable species. Fe³⁺ does not have as strong a tendency to get reduced as Mn³⁺. Therefore, $E°$ for Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ is small and positive.

- Conclusion: $E°(\text{Mn}^{3+}/\text{Mn}^{2+}) \gg E°(\text{Fe}^{3+}/\text{Fe}^{2+})$ because Fe³⁺ is more stable than Mn³⁺.

---

**(b) Iron has higher enthalpy of atomisation than that of copper.**

**Answer/Solution:** Enthalpy of atomisation depends on the strength of metallic bonds, which in turn depends on the number of **unpaired electrons** available for metallic bonding.

- Fe (Z=26): [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s² → **6 unpaired electrons** (in metallic state) available for bonding.
- Cu (Z=29): [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ → only **1 unpaired electron** for bonding (3d is completely filled).

Since iron has a greater number of unpaired electrons available for metallic bonding, its **metallic bonds are stronger**, and therefore iron has a **higher enthalpy of atomisation** than copper.

---

**(c) Sc³⁺ is colourless in aqueous solution whereas Ti³⁺ is coloured.**

**Answer/Solution:** Transition metal compounds are coloured due to **d-d electronic transitions** — electrons are excited from one d-orbital to a higher d-orbital by absorbing visible light, and the complementary colour is observed.

- **Sc³⁺** (Z=21): Electronic configuration = [Ar] 3d⁰ → **no d-electrons**. d-d transition is impossible. Therefore Sc³⁺ is **colourless**.

- **Ti³⁺** (Z=22): Electronic configuration = [Ar] 3d¹ → **one d-electron** is present. d-d transition is possible. The electron absorbs visible light and gets excited. Therefore Ti³⁺ is **coloured** (violet).

### Q18.
Write the chemical reactions involved in the process of extraction of Gold. Explain the role of dilute NaCN and Zn in this process.

**Answer:**

**Step 1 — Leaching of Gold with dilute NaCN (role of NaCN):**

$$4\text{Au}(s) + 8\text{CN}^-(aq) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(aq) + \text{O}_2(g) \longrightarrow 4[\text{Au(CN)}_2]^-(aq) + 4\text{OH}^-(aq)$$

**Role of NaCN:** Gold is leached (dissolved) with a dilute solution of NaCN in the presence of air (O₂). The CN⁻ ions act as a **complexing agent**, forming the stable soluble complex $[\text{Au(CN)}_2]^-$ (dicyanoaurate(I) ion), which allows gold to be separated from the ore.

**Step 2 — Precipitation of Gold with Zn (role of Zn):**

$$2[\text{Au(CN)}_2]^-(aq) + \text{Zn}(s) \longrightarrow [\text{Zn(CN)}_4]^{2-}(aq) + 2\text{Au}(s)$$

**Role of Zn:** Zinc acts as a **reducing agent** (displacement agent). Being more electropositive than gold, zinc displaces gold from the complex solution. This process is called **reduction** or **precipitation**. The gold is obtained as a solid metal deposit.

---

### Q19.
Define the following with an example of each:

**(a) Polysaccharides**

**Answer/Solution:** Polysaccharides are carbohydrates that contain a **large number of monosaccharide units** joined together by **glycosidic linkages** (C–O–C bonds). They are polymers of simple sugars.

**Example:** Starch (made of α-glucose units), Cellulose (made of β-glucose units)

---

**(b) Denatured protein**

**Answer/Solution:** Denaturation is a process in which a protein loses its **secondary and tertiary structure** (native structure) due to physical changes (heat, UV radiation) or chemical changes (change in pH, addition of chemicals). The hydrogen bonds are disrupted and the protein loses its biological activity. The resulting protein is called a **denatured protein**.

**Example:** Coagulation of egg white (albumin) on boiling; curdling of milk.

---

**(c) Essential amino acids**

**Answer/Solution:** Essential amino acids are those amino acids which **cannot be synthesised** in the human body and must be obtained from the **diet** (food). There are 10 essential amino acids.

**Examples:** Histidine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Arginine

---

**OR**

**(a) Write the product when D-glucose reacts with conc. HNO₃.**

**Answer/Solution:** Conc. HNO₃ is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises both the aldehyde group (–CHO) and the primary alcohol group (–CH₂OH) of D-glucose to –COOH groups, yielding **saccharic acid (glucaric acid)**:

$$\text{D-Glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{conc. HNO}_3,\ \Delta} \text{Saccharic acid (D-glucaric acid)}$$

[Diagram: D-glucose (CHO at C1, four CHOH groups, CH₂OH at C6) is oxidised to saccharic acid (COOH at C1, four CHOH groups, COOH at C6)]

Structure of Saccharic acid:
$$\text{HOOC–(CHOH)}_4\text{–COOH}$$

---

**(b) Amino acids show amphoteric behaviour. Why?**

**Answer/Solution:** Amino acids contain **both an amino group (–NH₂)** (basic) and a **carboxyl group (–COOH)** (acidic) in the same molecule.

- The –COOH group can donate a proton (acts as an acid).
- The –NH₂ group can accept a proton (acts as a base).

In solution, an intramolecular proton transfer occurs, forming a **zwitter ion (dipolar ion)**:

$$\text{R–CH(NH}_2\text{)–COOH} \rightleftharpoons \text{R–CH(NH}_3^+\text{)–COO}^-$$

Since an amino acid can act as both an acid and a base, it shows **amphoteric behaviour**.

---

**(c) Write one difference between α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures of proteins.**

| Feature | α-Helix | β-Pleated Sheet |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | The polypeptide chain coils into a right-handed helical screw, stabilised by **intramolecular hydrogen bonds** between the C=O of one amino acid and N–H of the fourth amino acid along the same chain. | The polypeptide chains are stretched out to nearly maximum extension and laid **side by side**, held together by **intermolecular hydrogen bonds** between adjacent chains. |
| **Shape** | Compact, cylindrical coil | Extended, sheet-like pleated structure |

### Q20.
A first order reaction is 50% completed in 40 minutes at 300 K and in 20 minutes at 320 K. Calculate the activation energy of the reaction.

(Given: log 2 = 0.3010, log 4 = 0.6021, R = 8.314 JK⁻¹ mol⁻¹)

**Answer:** $E_a = 27764\ \text{J} = 27.76\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$

**Solution:**

For a first order reaction, the rate constant is related to the half-life by:
$$k = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}$$

At $T_1 = 300\ \text{K}$, $t_{1/2} = 40\ \text{min}$:
$$k_1 = \frac{0.693}{40}$$

At $T_2 = 320\ \text{K}$, $t_{1/2} = 20\ \text{min}$:
$$k_2 = \frac{0.693}{20}$$

Using the Arrhenius equation in logarithmic form:
$$\log\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{E_a}{2.303R}\left(\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}\right)$$

$$\log\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \log\left(\frac{0.693/20}{0.693/40}\right) = \log\left(\frac{40}{20}\right) = \log 2 = 0.3010$$

Substituting values:
$$0.3010 = \frac{E_a}{2.303 \times 8.314} \times \left(\frac{320 - 300}{320 \times 300}\right)$$

$$0.3010 = \frac{E_a}{2.303 \times 8.314} \times \frac{20}{96000}$$

$$E_a = \frac{0.3010 \times 2.303 \times 8.314 \times 96000}{20}$$

$$\boxed{E_a = 27764\ \text{J mol}^{-1} \approx 27.76\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}}$$

### Q21.

**(a) Why is bithional added to soap?**

**Answer/Solution:** Bithional (an antiseptic) is added to **medicated soaps** to reduce the odour produced by the **bacterial decomposition of organic matter** on the skin. It acts as an antiseptic/disinfectant and inhibits bacterial growth.

---

**(b) What is tincture of iodine? Write its one use.**

**Answer/Solution:** Tincture of iodine is a **2–3% solution of iodine in alcohol-water** mixture.

**Use:** It is used as an **antiseptic** — applied on wounds to kill germs and prevent infection.

---

**(c) Among the following, which one acts as a food preservative?**

Aspartame, Aspirin, Sodium Benzoate, Paracetamol

**Answer:** **Sodium Benzoate** is used as a food preservative.

**Solution:**
- Aspartame → artificial sweetener
- Aspirin → analgesic/antipyretic drug
- Sodium Benzoate → food preservative (prevents microbial growth in food)
- Paracetamol → analgesic/antipyretic drug

### Q22.
What happens when:

**(a) A freshly prepared precipitate of Fe(OH)₃ is shaken with a small amount of FeCl₃ solution?**

**Answer/Solution:** The freshly prepared precipitate of Fe(OH)₃ is **peptized** by the FeCl₃ solution. The Fe³⁺ ions from FeCl₃ are preferentially adsorbed on the surface of Fe(OH)₃ particles, imparting a positive charge to them. The charged particles repel each other and disperse to form a **colloidal sol**. This process is called **peptization**.

$$\text{Fe(OH)}_3 \text{ precipitate} + \text{FeCl}_3 \text{ (traces)} \longrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 \text{ colloidal sol (red-brown)}$$

---

**(b) Persistent dialysis of a colloidal solution is carried out?**

**Answer/Solution:** During dialysis, electrolytes (ions) diffuse through the semipermeable membrane and are removed. If dialysis is prolonged (persistent), almost all electrolytes are removed. The colloidal particles lose their charge (since the stabilising ions are removed), and the colloid becomes **unstable and coagulates** (precipitates out of solution).

---

**(c) An emulsion is centrifuged?**

**Answer/Solution:** When an emulsion is centrifuged, the **centrifugal force** causes the denser liquid to settle at the bottom and the lighter liquid rises to the top. The two liquids of the emulsion are **separated** from each other. This process is called **demulsification** by centrifugation.

### Q23.
Shyam went to a grocery shop to purchase some food items. The shopkeeper packed all the items in polythene bags and gave them to Shyam. But Shyam refused to accept the polythene bags and asked the shopkeeper to pack the items in paper bags. He informed the shopkeeper about the heavy penalty imposed by the government for using polythene bags. The shopkeeper promised that he would use paper bags in future in place of polythene bags.

Answer the following:

**(a) Write the values (at least two) shown by Shyam.**

**Answer:**
1. **Environmental responsibility** — Shyam is aware of the harmful effects of polythene on the environment and refuses to contribute to pollution.
2. **Social responsibility / Moral values** — He educates the shopkeeper about government regulations and environmental hazards.
3. **Law-abiding nature** — He is aware of government policies and adheres to them.

---

**(b) Write one structural difference between low-density polythene and high-density polythene.**

**Answer:**

| Property | LDPE | HDPE |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | **Branched** chain polymer — has many side chains/branches along the main chain | **Linear** (unbranched) polymer — polymer chains are linear with very few or no branches |

**Solution:** Due to branching in LDPE, the chains cannot pack closely → lower density. HDPE has linear chains that pack closely → higher density.

---

**(c) Why did Shyam refuse to accept the items in polythene bags?**

**Answer/Solution:** Polythene is a **non-biodegradable polymer** — microorganisms cannot break it down. Therefore:
- It accumulates in the environment as **landfills**, causing soil and water pollution.
- If **burnt**, it releases toxic gases and causes **air pollution**.
- It is harmful to animals that accidentally ingest it.

Hence, polythene bags are environmentally hazardous, and Shyam refused to accept them in order to protect the environment.

---

**(d) What is a biodegradable polymer? Give an example.**

**Answer/Solution:** Biodegradable polymers are polymers that can be **degraded by microorganisms** (bacteria, fungi) within a suitable time period into simple, non-toxic substances (CO₂, H₂O, biomass), so that they do not cause any serious harm to the environment.

**Examples:**
- **PHBV** (Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-co-β-hydroxyvalerate) — used in packaging, surgical stitches
- **Dextron** (PLA — polylactic acid)
- **Nylon-2-nylon-6** (polyamide copolymer)

### Q24.

**(a) Write the cell reaction and calculate the e.m.f. of the following cell at 298 K:**

$$\text{Sn}(s)\ |\ \text{Sn}^{2+}(0.004\ M)\ \|\ \text{H}^+(0.020\ M)\ |\ \text{H}_2(g)(1\ \text{bar})\ |\ \text{Pt}(s)$$

Given: $E°_{\text{Sn}^{2+}/\text{Sn}} = -0.14\ \text{V}$

**Answer:** $E_{\text{cell}} = 0.111\ \text{V}$

**Solution:**

**Cell Reactions:**

At anode (oxidation):
$$\text{Sn}(s) \longrightarrow \text{Sn}^{2+}(aq) + 2e^-$$

At cathode (reduction):
$$2\text{H}^+(aq) + 2e^- \longrightarrow \text{H}_2(g)$$

**Overall redox reaction:**
$$\text{Sn}(s) + 2\text{H}^+(aq) \longrightarrow \text{Sn}^{2+}(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)$$

**Standard EMF:**
$$E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}} = 0.00 - (-0.14) = +0.14\ \text{V}$$

**Applying Nernst Equation** (n = 2):
$$E = E°_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591}{n}\log\frac{[\text{Sn}^{2+}] \times P_{\text{H}_2}}{[\text{H}^+]^2}$$

$$E = 0.14 - \frac{0.0591}{2}\log\frac{0.004 \times 1}{(0.020)^2}$$

$$E = 0.14 - 0.02955 \times \log\frac{4 \times 10^{-3}}{4 \times 10^{-4}}$$

$$E = 0.14 - 0.02955 \times \log 10$$

$$E = 0.14 - 0.02955 \times 1$$

$$\boxed{E_{\text{cell}} = 0.111\ \text{V}}$$

---

**(b) Give reasons:**

**(i) On the basis of E° values, O₂ gas should be liberated at anode but it is Cl₂ gas which is liberated in the electrolysis of aqueous NaCl.**

**Answer/Solution:** Theoretically, based on standard reduction potential values:
$$E°_{\text{Cl}_2/\text{Cl}^-} = +1.36\ \text{V} \quad \text{and} \quad E°_{\text{O}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}} = +1.23\ \text{V}$$

Since water has a lower reduction potential, it should be oxidised preferentially at the anode, liberating O₂. However, in the electrolysis of **concentrated aqueous NaCl**, **Cl₂ is liberated** due to:
1. **Overvoltage (overpotential):** Oxidation of water to O₂ requires a significantly higher overvoltage than predicted by thermodynamics. The actual voltage needed for O₂ evolution is much higher.
2. **High concentration of Cl⁻ ions:** In concentrated NaCl solution, Cl⁻ ions are present in large numbers at the anode surface, making their discharge kinetically preferred.

As a result, Cl₂ is evolved rather than O₂.

---

**(ii) Conductivity of CH₃COOH decreases on dilution.**

**Answer/Solution:** Conductivity ($\kappa$, specific conductance) is defined as the conductance of a solution of **1 cm³** volume. It depends on the **number of ions per unit volume**.

When acetic acid (a weak electrolyte) is diluted:
- Although the **degree of dissociation increases** (more molecules ionise)
- The **number of ions per unit volume (concentration)** decreases significantly.

The decrease in ion concentration per unit volume outweighs the increase in degree of dissociation. Therefore, the **conductivity (κ) decreases on dilution**.

(Note: Molar conductivity increases on dilution, but conductivity decreases.)

**OR**

**(a) For the reaction:**

$$2\text{AgCl}(s) + \text{H}_2(g)(1\ \text{atm}) \longrightarrow 2\text{Ag}(s) + 2\text{H}^+(0.1\ M) + 2\text{Cl}^-(0.1\ M)$$

$$\Delta G° = -43600\ \text{J at } 25°\text{C}$$

Calculate the e.m.f. of the cell.
[log 10⁻ⁿ = –n]

**Answer:** $E_{\text{cell}} = 0.3482\ \text{V}$

**Solution:**

**Finding E°cell from ΔG°:**
$$\Delta G° = -nFE°$$

$$-43600 = -2 \times 96500 \times E°$$

$$E° = \frac{43600}{2 \times 96500} = 0.23\ \text{V}$$

**Applying Nernst Equation** (n = 2):
$$E = E°_{\text{cell}} - \frac{0.0591}{2}\log\frac{[\text{H}^+]^2[\text{Cl}^-]^2}{P_{\text{H}_2}}$$

$$E = 0.23 - \frac{0.0591}{2}\log\frac{(0.1)^2 \times (0.1)^2}{1}$$

$$E = 0.23 - 0.02955 \times \log(0.1)^4$$

$$E = 0.23 - 0.02955 \times \log(10^{-4})$$

$$E = 0.23 - 0.02955 \times (-4)$$

$$E = 0.23 + 0.1182$$

$$\boxed{E_{\text{cell}} = 0.3482\ \text{V}}$$

---

**(b) Define fuel cell and write its two advantages.**

**Answer/Solution:**

**Definition:** A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell (voltaic/galvanic cell) in which the **chemical energy from the combustion of fuels** (like H₂, CH₄, methanol) is **directly converted into electrical energy**. The reactants (fuel and oxidant) are **continuously supplied** to the electrodes during operation.

Example: Hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell:
- At anode: $\text{H}_2 + 2\text{OH}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^-$
- At cathode: $\frac{1}{2}\text{O}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + 2e^- \rightarrow 2\text{OH}^-$

**Advantages:**
1. Fuel cells operate with an **efficiency of 60–70%**, much higher than conventional heat engines (~40%).
2. There are **no objectionable or polluting by-products** — hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells produce only water. Therefore, they are a **pollution-free source of energy**.

### Q25.

**(a) Write the reactions involved in the following:**

**(i) Hofmann bromamide degradation reaction**

**Answer/Solution:** In this reaction, an amide reacts with bromine in aqueous NaOH to give a primary amine with one fewer carbon atom:

$$\text{R–CH}_2\text{–C(=O)–NH}_2 + 4\text{NaOH} + \text{Br}_2 \longrightarrow \text{R–CH}_2\text{–NH}_2 + \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{NaBr} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Example:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{C(=O)NH}_2 + 4\text{NaOH} + \text{Br}_2 \longrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{NH}_2 + \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{NaBr} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

(Propionamide → Ethylamine: the amine product has one carbon less than the amide)

---

**(ii) Diazotisation**

**Answer/Solution:** Diazotisation is the reaction of a **primary aromatic amine** with nitrous acid (HNO₂, generated in situ from NaNO₂ + HCl) at **0–5°C** to form a **diazonium salt**:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + \text{NaNO}_2 + \text{HCl} \xrightarrow{0\text{–}5°\text{C}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}} \equiv \text{N}\ \text{Cl}^- + \text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

[Diagram: Aniline reacts with NaNO₂/HCl at 0–5°C to form benzene diazonium chloride]

---

**(iii) Gabriel phthalamide synthesis**

**Answer/Solution:** This reaction is used to prepare **primary aliphatic amines**. Phthalimide is treated with KOH to form the potassium salt, which then reacts with an alkyl halide (R–X), followed by hydrolysis to give the primary amine:

**Step 1:** Phthalimide + KOH → Potassium phthalimide + H₂O

**Step 2:** Potassium phthalimide + R–X → N-alkyl phthalimide + KX

**Step 3:** N-alkyl phthalimide + H⁺/H₂O (hydrolysis) → R–NH₂ + phthalic acid (o-HOOC–C₆H₄–COOH)

[Diagram: Phthalimide (bicyclic structure with N–H) → KOH → potassium phthalimide (N–K⁺) → R–X → N-alkyl phthalimide → H⁺/H₂O → primary amine (R–NH₂) + phthalic acid]

---

**(b) Give reasons:**

**(i) (CH₃)₂NH is more basic than (CH₃)₃N in an aqueous solution.**

**Answer/Solution:** In aqueous solution, basicity of amines depends on:
1. **+I (inductive) effect** of alkyl groups — increases electron density on N
2. **Solvation of the conjugate acid (ammonium ion)** — more H atoms on N⁺ → better solvation → more stable → stronger base

For $(CH_3)_3N$ (tertiary amine): The trimethylammonium ion $(CH_3)_3\text{NH}^+$ has only **1 N–H bond** for hydrogen bonding with water → **poor solvation** → less stable → weaker base in water.

For $(CH_3)_2NH$ (secondary amine): The dimethylammonium ion $(CH_3)_2\text{NH}_2^+$ has **2 N–H bonds** → **better solvation** by water molecules → more stable → stronger base in water.

Therefore, $(CH_3)_2NH$ is more basic than $(CH_3)_3N$ in aqueous solution due to the combined effect of inductive effect and better solvation of the conjugate acid.

---

**(ii) Aromatic diazonium salts are more stable than aliphatic diazonium salts.**

**Answer/Solution:** In aromatic diazonium salts (e.g., $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}}\equiv\text{N}$), the positive charge on the diazonium group is **delocalized over the benzene ring** through resonance:

[Diagram: Resonance structures of benzenediazonium ion showing dispersal of positive charge onto the ortho and para positions of the benzene ring]

$$\overset{+}{\text{N}} \equiv \text{N} - \text{C}_6\text{H}_5 \longleftrightarrow \text{N} = \overset{+}{\text{N}} = \text{C}_6\text{H}_5^- \longleftrightarrow \text{etc.}$$

This **dispersal/delocalization of the positive charge** stabilizes the aromatic diazonium salt.

In **aliphatic diazonium salts**, the alkyl group cannot participate in resonance, so **charge dispersal is not possible** → they are highly unstable and decompose immediately.

---

**OR**

**(a) Write the structures of the main products of the following reactions:**

**(i)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 \xrightarrow{(\text{CH}_3\text{CO})_2\text{O},\ \text{Pyridine}} ?$$

**Answer/Solution:** Aniline reacts with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine (as a base) to undergo **acetylation (acylation)**, giving acetanilide:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + (\text{CH}_3\text{CO})_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{Pyridine}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{–NH–C(=O)–CH}_3 + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$$

Product: **Acetanilide** (N-phenylethanamide)

---

**(ii)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_2\text{Cl} \xrightarrow{(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH}} ?$$

**Answer/Solution:** Benzenesulfonyl chloride reacts with dimethylamine (a secondary amine) to give a **sulfonamide**:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_2\text{Cl} + (\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH} \longrightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{SO}_2\text{–N(CH}_3)_2 + \text{HCl}$$

Product: **N,N-dimethylbenzenesulfonamide**

---

**(iii)**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}}_2\text{Cl}^- \xrightarrow{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}} ?$$

**Answer/Solution:** When benzene diazonium chloride reacts with ethanol, **reduction** of the diazonium salt occurs, replacing the diazonium group (–N₂⁺) with a hydrogen atom, and ethanol is oxidised to acetaldehyde:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}}_2\text{Cl}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \longrightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 + \text{N}_2 + \text{CH}_3\text{CHO} + \text{HCl}$$

Product: **Benzene**

---

**(b) Give a simple chemical test to distinguish between Aniline and N,N-dimethylaniline.**

**Answer/Solution:** Use the **Carbylamine (isocyanide) test**:

- **Aniline** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$, primary amine): Reacts with CHCl₃ and KOH to give **phenyl isocyanide** (foul-smelling compound):

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 + \text{CHCl}_3 + 3\text{KOH} \longrightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\overset{+}{\text{N}} \equiv \overset{-}{\text{C}} + 3\text{KCl} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

The formation of the **foul-smelling isocyanide** confirms the presence of a primary amine.

- **N,N-dimethylaniline** ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{N(CH}_3)_2$, tertiary amine): Does **not react** with CHCl₃ and KOH → **no foul smell**.

**Conclusion:** The compound that gives a foul-smelling product with CHCl₃/KOH is aniline.

---

**(c) Arrange the following in the increasing order of their pKb values:**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2,\quad \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2,\quad \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NHCH}_3$$

**Answer:**

$$\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 < \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 < \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NHCH}_3$$

(Increasing pKb = decreasing basicity)

**Solution:**
- $\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$ (ethylamine, aliphatic amine): Most basic due to +I effect of ethyl group → **lowest pKb**
- $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$ (aniline): Lone pair on N is delocalized into the benzene ring (–M effect) → less basic → **higher pKb**
- $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NHCH}_3$ (N-methylaniline): The –CH₃ group's +I effect is offset by greater delocalization of the lone pair; the lone pair is still delocalized into the ring, and steric factors make the N less basic → **highest pKb**

---

### Q26.
Give reasons:

**(i) H₃PO₃ undergoes disproportionation reaction but H₃PO₄ does not.**

**Answer/Solution:**

- In $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_3$ (phosphorous acid): Oxidation state of P = **+3**. Since P is in an intermediate oxidation state (+3), it can undergo both **oxidation** (to +5) and **reduction** (to 0 or –3). Therefore, H₃PO₃ can **disproportionate**:

$$4\text{H}_3\text{PO}_3 \longrightarrow 3\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4 + \text{PH}_3$$

- In $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$ (phosphoric acid): Oxidation state of P = **+5**. This is the **highest** oxidation state of phosphorus. It can only undergo reduction (act as oxidising agent) but **cannot be oxidised further**. Therefore, H₃PO₄ cannot undergo disproportionation.

---

**(ii) When Cl₂ reacts with excess of F₂, ClF₃ is formed and not FCl₃.**

**Answer/Solution:** Fluorine is the most electronegative element and can exist only in the **–1 oxidation state**. It cannot show positive oxidation states.

Chlorine, being less electronegative, can show **positive oxidation states** when bonded to the more electronegative fluorine.

In $\text{ClF}_3$: Cl has oxidation state = **+3** (which is possible for Cl).

If $\text{FCl}_3$ were formed, F would need to be in **+3 oxidation state** — which is **impossible** for fluorine due to its high electronegativity and absence of d-orbitals.

Therefore, only $\text{ClF}_3$ is formed, not $\text{FCl}_3$.

---

**(iii) Dioxygen is a gas while Sulphur is a solid at room temperature.**

**Answer/Solution:**

- **O₂** (Dioxygen): Oxygen forms a **diatomic molecule** ($\text{O}=\text{O}$) with a $p\pi – p\pi$ double bond (due to small size and availability of p-orbitals for lateral overlap). The intermolecular forces in O₂ are **very weak van der Waals forces**. Therefore, dioxygen is a **gas** at room temperature with very low bo
