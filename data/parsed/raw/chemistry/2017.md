### Q3.
What is the effect of adding a catalyst on:
(a) Activation energy ($E_a$), and
(b) Gibbs energy ($\Delta G$) of a reaction?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Effect on Activation Energy ($E_a$):**
A catalyst provides a new reaction pathway in which a lower activation energy is offered. Hence, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by **lowering** the activation energy.

**(b) Effect on Gibbs Energy ($\Delta G$):**
Gibbs free energy will **remain the same**, as for a catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction, the equilibrium constant is not affected — which is a function of Gibbs free energy.

### Q4.
Out of the following two compounds, which is an example of allylic halide?

[Diagram: Two cyclic structures — (i) a cyclohexane ring with X substituent at a saturated carbon adjacent to a double bond, and (ii) a cyclohexane ring with X substituent directly on the double bond carbon]

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The compound with the halogen (X) attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbon–carbon double bond is the allylic halide.

[Diagram: Cyclohexene ring with –X group on the carbon adjacent to the C=C double bond (allylic position)]

This is the **allylic halide**, as the halogen is on the allylic carbon (carbon next to the double bond).

### Q6.
(a) Arrange the following compounds in the increasing order of their acid strength:

p-Cresol, p-Nitrophenol, Phenol

(b) Write the mechanism (using curved arrow notation) of the following reaction:

$$CH_2=CH_2 \xrightarrow{H_3O^+} CH_3-CH_2^+ + H_2O$$

**OR**

Write the structures of the products when Butan-2-ol reacts with the following:
(a) CrO₃
(b) SOCl₂

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Increasing order of acid strength:**

$$\text{p-Cresol} < \text{Phenol} < \text{p-Nitrophenol}$$

[Diagram: Structural comparison of three phenols — p-Cresol (with –CH₃ group), Phenol, and p-Nitrophenol (with –NO₂ group)]

**Reason:**
- The –NO₂ group is an electron-withdrawing group (–M effect), which withdraws electron density from the benzene ring, stabilizing the conjugate base of p-nitrophenol. Higher stability of conjugate base → higher acidity.
- In the case of p-cresol, the +I effect of the methyl group destabilizes the conjugate base, making it the weakest acid.

**(b) Mechanism of the reaction:**

$$CH_2=CH_2 + H^{\oplus} \longrightarrow CH_3-\overset{\oplus}{C}H_2$$

$$CH_3-\overset{\oplus}{C}H_2 + H_2O \longrightarrow CH_3-CH_2-\overset{\oplus}{O}H_2 \xrightarrow{-H^{\oplus}} CH_3-CH_2-\ddot{O}-H$$

Step 1: Protonation of ethene by H⁺ to form carbocation.
Step 2: Attack of water (nucleophile) on the carbocation.
Step 3: Deprotonation to give ethanol.

$$\quad\quad\quad\quad OH \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Cl$$
$$\text{2-Butanol}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{2-Chlorobutane}$$

### Q7.
Calculate the number of unit cells in 8.1 g of aluminum if it crystallizes in a face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) structure.
(Atomic mass of Al = 27 g mol⁻¹)

**Answer:** $0.075 \times N_A$ unit cells

**Solution:**

Moles of aluminum:
$$n_{Al} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{8.1}{27} = 0.3 \text{ moles}$$

In an f.c.c. unit cell, the number of atoms per unit cell = **4**

Therefore:
- 4 atoms are found in 1 unit cell
- 1 atom is found in $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell
- $N_A$ atoms (1 mole) are found in $\frac{N_A}{4}$ unit cells

For 0.3 moles of Al:
$$\text{Number of unit cells} = \frac{N_A}{4} \times 0.3 = 0.075 \times N_A$$

**Solution:**

**(a) H₂SO₃ (Sulphurous acid):**

[Diagram: Central sulfur atom with one lone pair on top, double bonded to one oxygen atom at the bottom (S=O), and single bonded to two –OH groups on either side]

$$\text{Structure: S atom with one } S=O \text{ bond and two } S-OH \text{ bonds, plus one lone pair on S}$$

**(b) HClO₃ (Chloric acid):**

[Diagram: Central chlorine atom with one lone pair, double bonded to two oxygen atoms (:O= and =O:) and single bonded to one –O–H group]

$$\text{Structure: Cl atom bonded to two } C=O \text{ groups and one } -O-H \text{ group, with one lone pair on Cl}$$

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q11.
(a) Based on the nature of intermolecular forces, classify the following solids: Silicon carbide, Argon

(b) ZnO turns yellow on heating. Why?

(c) What is meant by groups 12–16 compounds? Give an example.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Classification of solids based on intermolecular forces:**

| Solid | Type | Forces |
|---|---|---|
| Silicon carbide | Covalent (network) solid | Covalent bonding |
| Argon | Non-polar molecular solid | Dispersion (London) forces |

**(b) ZnO turns yellow on heating:**

Zinc oxide is white in color at room temperature. On heating, it loses oxygen and turns yellow:

$$ZnO \xrightarrow{\Delta} Zn^{+2} + \frac{1}{2}O_2 + 2e^{\ominus}$$

The excess $Zn^{2+}$ ions move to interstitial sites and the electrons to neighboring interstitial sites. This causes a metal excess defect, which imparts a yellow color to ZnO.

**(c) Group 12–16 compounds:**

Some compounds formed between elements of Group 12 and Group 16 are called **Group 12–16 compounds**. In these compounds, bonds have both ionic and covalent character.

**Examples:** ZnS, CdSe, HgTe

### Q12.
(a) The cell in which the following reaction occurs:

$$2Fe^{3+}(aq) + 2I^-(aq) \rightarrow 2Fe^{2+}(aq) + I_2(s)$$

has $E°_{cell}$ = 0.236 V at 298 K. Calculate the standard Gibbs energy of the cell reaction.
(Given: 1F = 96,500 C mol⁻¹)

(b) How many electrons flow through a metallic wire if a current of 0.5 A is passed for 2 hours?
(Given: 1F = 96,500 C mol⁻¹)

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Standard Gibbs Energy:**

The two half-cell reactions are:
$$2Fe^{3+}(aq) + 2e^{\ominus} \longrightarrow 2Fe^{2+} \quad \text{(Reduction)}$$
$$2I^{\ominus} \longrightarrow I_2 + 2e^{\ominus} \quad \text{(Oxidation)}$$

Number of electrons transferred, $n = 2$

Using the formula:
$$\Delta_r G° = -nFE°_{cell}$$
$$\Delta_r G° = -(2 \text{ mol}) \times (96500 \text{ mol}^{-1}) \times (0.236 \text{ V})$$
$$\Delta_r G° = -45548 \text{ CV}$$
$$\boxed{\Delta_r G° = -45548 \text{ J} \approx -45.55 \text{ kJ}}$$

**(b) Number of electrons flowing through the wire:**

Charge passed:
$$Q = I \times t = 0.5\text{ A} \times (2 \times 60 \times 60 \text{ s}) = 0.5 \times 7200 = 3600 \text{ C}$$

Number of electrons for 96500 C (1 Faraday) $= 6.022 \times 10^{23}$

Number of electrons for 3600 C:
$$= \frac{6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 3600}{96500} = 2.246 \times 10^{22} \text{ electrons}$$

### Q13.
(a) What type of isomerism is shown by the complex $[Co(NH_3)_5(SCN)]^{2+}$?

(b) Why is $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ paramagnetic while $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$ is diamagnetic?
(Atomic number of Ni = 28)

(c) Why are low spin tetrahedral complexes rarely observed?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Type of isomerism:**

The complex $[Co(NH_3)_5(SCN)]^{2+}$ exhibits **linkage isomerism**, because the SCN⁻ ligand can coordinate through either sulfur (–SCN, thiocyanato) or nitrogen (–NCS, isothiocyanato).

**(b) $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ is paramagnetic while $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$ is diamagnetic:**

In both complexes, nickel is in +2 oxidation state with configuration $3d^8$, containing **2 unpaired electrons**.

- **CN⁻** is a **strong field ligand** (strong ligand) — it forces the pairing of electrons. The electron density is pushed, causing pairing of the $d$-electrons. Hence $[Ni(CN)_4]^{2-}$ has **no unpaired electrons** → **diamagnetic**.
- **Cl⁻** is a **weak field ligand** — it does not cause pairing. Hence $[NiCl_4]^{2-}$ retains **2 unpaired electrons** → **paramagnetic**.

**(c) Low spin tetrahedral complexes rarely observed:**

In tetrahedral complexes, the energy gap ($\Delta_t$) between the two sets of $d$-orbitals ($e$ and $t_2$) is very small — approximately $\frac{4}{9}$ of the octahedral splitting ($\Delta_o$). Because of this very small energy gap, electrons always occupy higher energy levels rather than pairing, so low spin configurations are very rarely achieved in tetrahedral complexes.

(b) Write one similarity between physisorption and chemisorption.
(c) Write the chemical method by which Fe(OH)₃ sol is prepared from FeCl₃.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Multimolecular colloid vs. Associated colloid:**

|---|---|
| Consists of aggregates of atoms or small molecules with diameter less than 1 nm. Example: gold sol | Dispersed particles are themselves large molecules of colloidal dimensions. Example: cellulose, starch |

**(b) Coagulation vs. Peptization:**

| Coagulation | Peptization |
|---|---|
| The process of change of state from colloidal to suspended (precipitation) of colloidal particles by adding electrolyte. | Conversion of a precipitate into colloidal sol by shaking it with a dispersion medium in the presence of an electrolyte (peptizing agent). |

**(c) Homogeneous catalysis vs. Heterogeneous catalysis:**

| Homogeneous Catalysis | Heterogeneous Catalysis |
|---|---|
| Reactants and catalyst are in the **same phase**. | Reactants and catalyst are in **different phases**. |

---

**OR**

**(a) Dispersed phase and dispersion medium of milk:**

Milk is an **emulsion** (liquid dispersed in liquid).
- **Dispersed phase:** Liquid (fat/oil droplets)
- **Dispersion medium:** Liquid (water)

**(b) Similarity between physisorption and chemisorption:**

Both physisorption and chemisorption are **surface phenomena** — they occur at the surface of the adsorbent.

**(c) Chemical method for preparation of Fe(OH)₃ sol from FeCl₃:**

**Reaction (Hydrolysis):**
$$FeCl_3 + 3H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{Hydrolysis}} Fe(OH)_3\text{(sol)} + 3HCl$$

In this method, hydrolysis of ferric chloride occurs, by which molecules aggregate and lead to the formation of **ferric hydroxide colloidal sol**.

### Q15.
A first order reaction takes 20 minutes for 25% decomposition. Calculate the time when 75% of the reaction will be completed.

(Given: log 2 = 0.3010, log 3 = 0.4771, log 4 = 0.6021)

**Answer:** $t \approx 96.96$ minutes

**Solution:**

Given:
- $t = 20$ min for 25% decomposition
- $[A]_0 = 100\%$, $[A] = 100 - 25 = 75\%$

**Step 1: Calculate rate constant $k$**

For a first order reaction:
$$k = \frac{1}{t} \times 2.303 \log\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}$$
$$k = \frac{1}{20} \times 2.303 \log\frac{100}{75}$$
$$k = \frac{1}{20} \times 2.303 \times \log(1.33)$$
$$k = \frac{1}{20} \times 2.303 \times 0.1248$$
$$k = 0.0143 \text{ min}^{-1}$$

**Step 2: Calculate time for 75% completion**

When 75% is completed, $[A] = 100 - 75 = 25\%$

$$t = \frac{1}{k} \times 2.303 \log\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}$$
$$t = \frac{1}{0.0143} \times 2.303 \times \log\frac{100}{25}$$
$$t = \frac{1}{0.0143} \times 2.303 \times \log 4$$
$$t = \frac{1}{0.0143} \times 2.303 \times 0.6021$$
$$\boxed{t \approx 96.96 \text{ minutes}}$$

### Q16.
The following compounds are given to you:
2-Bromopentane, 2-Bromo-2-methylbutane, 1-Bromopentane

(a) Write the compound which is most reactive towards $S_N2$ reaction.
(b) Write the compound which is optically active.
(c) Write the compound which is most reactive towards $\beta$-elimination reaction.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Most reactive towards $S_N2$ reaction:**

$$CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-Br$$
$$\textbf{1-Bromopentane}$$

**Reason:** $S_N2$ reaction is favored by **primary** alkyl halides due to least steric hindrance. 1-Bromopentane is a primary halide.

**(b) Optically active compound:**

$$CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-\underset{*}{\underset{|}{C}}-CH_3$$
$$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Br \quad H$$
$$\textbf{2-Bromopentane}$$

**Reason:** 2-Bromopentane has a **chiral carbon** (C-2 bonded to four different groups: H, Br, CH₃, and –CH₂CH₂CH₃), making it optically active.

**(c) Most reactive towards $\beta$-elimination:**

$$CH_3-CH_2-\underset{|}{\overset{CH_3}{C}}-CH_3$$
$$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Br$$
$$\textbf{2-Bromo-2-methylbutane}$$

**Reason:** $\beta$-elimination (E2) is favored by **tertiary** alkyl halides. 2-Bromo-2-methylbutane is a tertiary halide with multiple $\beta$-hydrogens.

### Q17.
Write the principle of the following:
(a) Zone refining
(b) Froth floatation process
(c) Chromatography

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Zone refining:**

It is used to obtain metals of high purity. It is based on the principle that **impurities are more soluble in the molten state than in the solid state**. When a narrow molten zone is moved along the impure metal rod, impurities concentrate in the molten zone and are carried to one end of the rod.

**(b) Froth floatation process:**

It is used to concentrate sulphide ores. It is based on the fact that **mineral (ore) particles become wet by oil while gangue particles become wet by water**. A rotating paddle agitates the mixture and draws air into it. As a result, a froth is formed which carries the mineral particles to the surface where they can be skimmed off.

**(c) Chromatography:**

It is based on the principle that **different components of a mixture are differently adsorbed on an adsorbent**. The more strongly adsorbed components move slower while less adsorbed components move faster. The adsorbed components are then removed (eluted) by using suitable solvents.

### Q20.
Define the following:
(a) Anionic detergents
(b) Limited spectrum antibiotics
(c) Antiseptics

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Anionic detergents:**

Anionic detergents are the **sodium salts of sulphonated long chain alcohols or hydrocarbons**. The anionic part of the molecule is responsible for cleansing action.

**Example:** Sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate

[Diagram: Reaction showing Dodecylbenzene → (H₂SO₄) → Dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid → (NaOH/aq) → Sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate ($CH_3(CH_2)_{11}-C_6H_4-SO_3^{\ominus}Na^{\oplus}$)]

**(b) Limited spectrum antibiotics:**

Antibiotics which kill or inhibit a short range of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria are known as **narrow spectrum antibiotics**. If they are effective against only a **single organism or disease**, they are referred to as **limited spectrum antibiotics**.

**(c) Antiseptics:**

Antiseptics are chemicals that **kill or prevent the growth of microorganisms and are not harmful to living tissues**. They can be applied to living tissues such as wounds, cuts, and ulcers.

### Q21.
Give reasons for the following:
(a) Red phosphorus is less reactive than white phosphorus.
(b) Electron gain enthalpies of halogens are largely negative.
(c) N₂O₅ is more acidic than N₂O₃.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Red phosphorus is less reactive than white phosphorus:**

White phosphorus possesses **angle strain** in the $P_4$ molecule where the bond angles are only **60°**, making it highly reactive. It also has a low melting point and is soluble in organic solvents. Red phosphorus, on the other hand, has a polymeric structure with no angle strain, making it thermodynamically more stable and hence **less reactive**.

**(b) Electron gain enthalpies of halogens are largely negative:**

Halogens have:
- **High effective nuclear charge**
- **Smallest atomic size** among elements in their respective periods
- **7 electrons** in their valence shell, requiring only **one more electron** to attain the nearest noble gas configuration

This makes them highly prone to accepting electrons, resulting in **large negative electron gain enthalpies**.

**(c) N₂O₅ is more acidic than N₂O₃:**

In $N_2O_5$, nitrogen is in **+5 oxidation state**, while in $N_2O_3$, nitrogen is in **+3 oxidation state**. The rule is:

> **Higher the oxidation state of the central atom in a given oxide, higher will be its acidic character.**

Since N in $N_2O_5$ has a higher oxidation state than in $N_2O_3$, $N_2O_5$ is **more acidic**.

---

### Q22.
Give reasons for the following:
(a) Acetylation of aniline reduces its activation effect.
(b) CH₃NH₂ is more basic than C₆H₅NH₂.
(c) Although –NH₂ is an o/p directing group, yet aniline on nitration gives a significant amount of m-nitroaniline.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Acetylation of aniline reduces its activation effect:**

[Diagram: Aniline + acetic anhydride → (in pyridine) → Acetanilide intermediate → Acetanilide final product]

When acetylation of aniline occurs with acetic anhydride, it is converted into **acetanilide**, in which the lone pair on nitrogen is in conjugation with the **carbonyl oxygen** through resonance. This reduces the availability of the lone pair to the benzene ring, thereby reducing the activating (electron-donating) effect of the nitrogen.

**(b) CH₃NH₂ is more basic than C₆H₅NH₂:**

In aniline ($C_6H_5NH_2$), the lone pair of electrons on the –NH₂ group is in **conjugation with the benzene ring** (delocalized through resonance with the ring), making the electron density on nitrogen **less available** for donation to a proton.

[Diagram: Five resonating structures of aniline showing delocalization of lone pair from N into the ring]

In methylamine ($CH_3NH_2$), the methyl group exerts a **+I (inductive) effect**, increasing electron density on nitrogen, making it more available for protonation. Hence, **CH₃NH₂ is more basic** than $C_6H_5NH_2$.

**(c) Aniline gives significant amount of m-nitroaniline on nitration:**

Although –NH₂ is an ortho/para director, the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO₃ + conc. H₂SO₄) is strongly acidic. In acidic conditions, aniline gets **protonated** to form the **anilinium ion** ($C_6H_5NH_3^+$).

$$C_6H_5NH_2 \xrightarrow{H^{\oplus}} C_6H_5\overset{\oplus}{N}H_3 \xrightarrow{NO_2^{\oplus}, -H^{\oplus}} m\text{-nitroaniline}$$

The $-NH_3^+$ group is an **electron-withdrawing** and **meta-directing** group. Therefore, nitration of the anilinium ion gives predominantly the **meta product**.

## Section D — Value Based Question (4 Marks)

### Q23.
After watching a programme on TV about the presence of carcinogens (cancer causing agents) — Potassium bromate and Potassium iodate — in bread and other bakery products, Rupali, a Class XII student, decided to make others aware about the adverse effects of these carcinogens in foods. She consulted the school principal and requested him to instruct the canteen contractor to stop selling sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, and other bakery products to the students. The principal took immediate action and instructed the canteen contractor to replace bakery products with some protein and vitamin rich food like fruits, salads, sprouts, etc. The decision was welcomed by parents and students.

After reading the above passage, answer the following questions:
(a) What are the values (at least two) displayed by Rupali?
(b) Which polysaccharide component of carbohydrates is commonly present in bread?
(c) Write the two types of secondary structures of proteins.
(d) Give two examples of water soluble vitamins.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Values displayed by Rupali (at least two):**
1. **Awareness and social responsibility** — She was aware of the adverse effects of carcinogens in food and took initiative to inform others.
2. **Concern for health and humanity** — She was genuinely concerned for the health of fellow students and took action to protect them.
3. **Courage and leadership** — She approached the school principal to bring about a positive change.

**(b) Polysaccharide in bread:**

**OR**

(a) Following are the transition metal ions of 3d series:
$Ti^{4+}$, $V^{2+}$, $Mn^{3+}$, $Cr^{3+}$
(Atomic Numbers: Ti = 22, V = 23, Mn = 25, Cr = 24)

Answer the following:
(i) Which ion is most stable in an aqueous solution and why?
(ii) Which ion is a strong oxidising agent and why?
(iii) Which ion is colourless and why?

(b) Complete the following equations:
(i) $2MnO_4^- + 16H^+ + 5S^{2-} \longrightarrow$
(ii) $KMnO_4 \xrightarrow{\text{heat}}$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a)(i) Variable oxidation states in transition metals:**

In transition elements, both **ns** and **(n–1)d** electrons participate in bonding due to very little energy difference between them. When only ns electrons take part in bonding, they exhibit lower oxidation states. When both ns and (n–1)d electrons participate, they exhibit higher oxidation states. This leads to **variable oxidation states**.

**(a)(ii) Zn, Cd and Hg are soft metals:**

Transition elements are generally hard and have high melting and boiling points because they exhibit both **covalent and metallic bonding** due to partially filled d-orbitals. However, Group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg) have **completely filled (n–1)d orbitals** ($d^{10}$ configuration), so they cannot exhibit covalent bonding through d-orbitals. Only weak metallic bonds exist, making them **soft metals** with low melting points.

**(a)(iii) $E°$ for $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ is highly positive:**

$Mn^{2+}$ has a $d^5$ (half-filled) configuration, which is **extra stable** due to exchange energy. Therefore, $Mn^{3+}$ readily gets reduced to the stable $Mn^{2+}$, resulting in a **high positive $E°$** value for the $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{2+}$ couple.

In contrast, $Cr^{3+}$ ($d^3$, half-filled $t_{2g}$) is more stable than $Cr^{2+}$, so $Cr^{3+}$ does not easily reduce to $Cr^{2+}$, resulting in a **low $E°$** value.

**(b) Lanthanoids vs. Actinoids:**

**Similarity:**
- Both series of elements exhibit mainly **+3 oxidation state**.
- Both show **magnetic** and **spectral properties**.

**Difference:**

| Lanthanoids | Actinoids |
|---|---|
| Less tendency to form complexes | High tendency to form complexes |
| Do not form oxo-cations | Form oxo-cations, e.g., $UO_2^{2+}$, $TiO^{2+}$ |

---

**OR**

**(a)(i) Most stable ion in aqueous solution:**

**$Cr^{3+}$** is the most stable ion in aqueous solution.

**Reason:** $Cr^{3+}$ has a $d^3$ configuration (half-filled $t_{2g}$ sub-level), which gives it extra stability. It has a small size and high charge density, making it strongly stabilized by hydration in aqueous solution.

**(a)(ii) Strong oxidising agent:**

**$Mn^{3+}$** is the strongest oxidising agent.

**Reason:** $Mn^{2+}$ ($d^5$, half-filled) is more stable than $Mn^{3+}$ ($d^4$). Therefore, $Mn^{3+}$ has a strong tendency to gain an electron and be reduced to the stable $Mn^{2+}$, making it a **strong oxidising agent**.

**(a)(iii) Colourless ion:**

**$Ti^{4+}$** is colourless.

**Reason:** $Ti^{4+}$ has a $d^0$ configuration (no $d$-electrons). Since colour in transition metal ions arises from **d–d transitions**, and $Ti^{4+}$ has no $d$-electrons available for excitation, it is **colourless**.

**(b) Completed equations:**

**(i)**
$$2MnO_4^- + 16H^+ + 5S^{2-} \longrightarrow 2Mn^{2+} + 8H_2O + 5S$$

**(ii)**
$$2KMnO_4 \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} K_2MnO_4 + MnO_2 + O_2\uparrow$$

### Q25.
(a) A 10% solution (by mass) of sucrose in water has a freezing point of 269.15 K. Calculate the freezing point of 10% glucose in water if the freezing point of pure water is 273.15 K.

Given:
- Molar mass of sucrose = 342 g mol⁻¹
- Molar mass of glucose = 180 g mol⁻¹

(b) Define the following terms:
(i) Molality (m)
(ii) Abnormal molar mass

**OR**

(a) 30 g of urea (M = 60 g mol⁻¹) is dissolved in 846 g of water. Calculate the vapour pressure of water for this solution if vapour pressure of pure water at 298 K is 23.8 mm Hg.

(b) Write two differences between ideal solutions and non-ideal solutions.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Freezing point of 10% glucose solution:**

**For sucrose solution (10% by mass):**
- Mass of sucrose $(w) = 10$ g
- Mass of water = 90 g
- Molar mass of sucrose = 342 g/mol

Molality of sucrose solution:
$$m_{sucrose} = \frac{10}{342} \times \frac{1000}{90} = \frac{10000}{30780} = 0.325 \text{ mol/kg}$$

Depression in freezing point:
$$\Delta t_f = t_{f(\text{solvent})} - t_{f(\text{solution})} = 273.15 - 269.15 = 4 \text{ K}$$

Finding $K_f$:
$$\Delta t_f = K_f \times m$$
$$K_f = \frac{\Delta t_f}{m} = \frac{4}{0.325} = 12.30 \text{ K kg mol}^{-1}$$

**For glucose solution (10% by mass):**
- Mass of glucose $(w) = 10$ g
- Mass of water = 90 g
- Molar mass of glucose = 180 g/mol

Molality of glucose solution:
$$m_{glucose} = \frac{10}{180} \times \frac{1000}{90} = \frac{10000}{16200} = 0.617 \text{ mol/kg}$$

Depression in freezing point:
$$\Delta t_f = K_f \times m_{glucose} = 12.30 \times \frac{10 \times 1000}{180 \times 90} = 12.3 \times 0.617 \approx 7.7 \text{ K}$$

Freezing point of glucose solution:
$$t_{f(\text{solution})} = t_{f(\text{solvent})} - \Delta t_f = 273.15 - 7.7 = \boxed{265.45 \text{ K}}$$

**(b)(i) Molality (m):**

Molality is defined as the **number of moles of solute dissolved per kilogram (1000 g) of the solvent**.

$$m = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Mass of solvent in kg}}$$

**(b)(ii) Abnormal molar mass:**

When a substance undergoes **association or dissociation** in solution, the molar mass determined experimentally from colligative properties is **different from the theoretically expected (normal) value**. This experimentally determined molar mass is called the **abnormal molar mass**.

---

**OR**

**(a) Vapour pressure of the urea solution:**

Given:
- Mass of urea $(w_2) = 30$ g, $M_2 = 60$ g/mol
- Mass of water $(w_1) = 846$ g, $M_1 = 18$ g/mol
- $P° = 23.8$ mm Hg

Using Raoult's law (relative lowering of vapour pressure):
$$\frac{P° - P_s}{P°} = x_2 = \frac{W_2/M_2}{W_2/M_2 + W_1/M_1}$$

$$\frac{23.8 - P_s}{23.8} = \frac{30/60}{30/60 + 846/18}$$

$$\frac{23.8 - P_s}{23.8} = \frac{0.5}{0.5 + 47} = \frac{0.5}{47.5} = 0.01053$$

$$23.8 - P_s = 0.01053 \times 23.8 = 0.2506$$

$$P_s = 23.8 - 0.2506 \approx \boxed{23.54 \text{ mm Hg}}$$

**(b) Differences between ideal and non-ideal solutions:**

| Ideal Solutions | Non-ideal Solutions |
|---|---|
| Obey Raoult's law at every range of concentration. | Do not obey Raoult's law. |
| Neither heat is absorbed nor evolved during dissolution ($\Delta H_{mix} = 0$). | Heat is either evolved (negative deviation) or absorbed (positive deviation) during dissolution ($\Delta H_{mix} \neq 0$). |

[Diagram: Cyclohexanone reacts with HCN to give cyclohexanone cyanohydrin — a cyclohexane ring with –OH and –CN groups on the same carbon at the carbonyl position]

Product: **Cyclohexanone cyanohydrin** (1-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbonitrile)

**(ii) Sodium benzoate + NaOH $\xrightarrow{CaO, \Delta}$:**

$$C_6H_5COONa + NaOH \xrightarrow{CaO, \Delta} C_6H_6 + Na_2CO_3$$

Product: **Benzene** ($C_6H_6$)

[Diagram: Sodium benzoate with CaO/NaOH heat → Benzene ring]

**(iii) $CH_3-CH=CH-CN \xrightarrow{(a)\text{ DIBAL-H}, (b)H_2O}$:**

$$CH_3-CH=CH-CN \xrightarrow{(a)\text{ DIBAL-H}} \xrightarrow{(b)H_2O} CH_3-CH=CH-CHO$$

Product: **But-2-enal** (Crotonaldehyde)

DIBAL-H reduces the nitrile (–CN) group to an aldehyde (–CHO).

---

**(b) Chemical tests to distinguish:**

**(i) Butanal and Butan-2-one:**

These compounds can be distinguished using **Tollen's reagent** (silver mirror test):

$$CH_3CH_2CH_2CHO + 2[Ag(NH_3)_2]^{\oplus} + 3OH^{\ominus} \longrightarrow CH_3CH_2CH_2COO^{\ominus} + 2Ag\downarrow + 4NH_3 + 2H_2O$$
$$\underbrace{\text{Butanal}}_{\text{Aldehyde}} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{Tollens' Reagent} \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \underbrace{\quad}_{\text{silver mirror formed}}$$

$$CH_3COCH_2CH_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Tollens' Reagent}} \text{No silver mirror formed}$$
$$\underbrace{\quad}_{\text{Butan-2-one (ketone)}}$$

- **Butanal** (aldehyde): Gives **silver mirror** with Tollen's reagent ✓
- **Butan-2-one** (ketone): **No silver mirror** ✗

**(ii) Benzoic acid and Phenol:**

Both can be distinguished using **FeCl₃ test**:

$$C_6H_5OH + FeCl_3 \longrightarrow \textbf{Violet colouration}$$
$$\underbrace{\quad}_{\text{Phenol}}$$

$$3C_6H_5COOH + FeCl_3 \longrightarrow (C_6H_5COO)_3Fe + 3HCl$$
$$\underbrace{\quad}_{\text{Benzoic acid}} \quad\quad\quad\quad \underbrace{\quad}_{\text{Buff-coloured precipitate}}$$

- **Phenol:** Gives **violet/purple colouration** with FeCl₃ ✓
- **Benzoic acid:** Gives a **buff-coloured precipitate** (ferric benzoate) with FeCl₃ ✓
