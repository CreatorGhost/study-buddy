## Section A — Objective Questions (1 mark each)

### Q1.
Which of the following has the highest melting point?

(a) NaCl
(b) KCl
(c) MgCl₂
(d) CaCl₂

**Answer:** (a) NaCl

**Solution:** Among the given ionic compounds, NaCl has the highest melting point. Although MgCl₂ has a higher charge density (Mg²⁺ is divalent), NaCl is listed as the correct answer here as per the answer key. Generally, higher lattice energy corresponds to a higher melting point, and NaCl has a very high lattice energy due to the small ionic radii of Na⁺ and Cl⁻.

### Q2.
The bond order in $O_2^+$ ion is

(a) 2.5
(b) 3.0
(c) 1.5
(d) 2.0

**Answer:** (a) 2.5

**Solution:** Using Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT), the electronic configuration of $O_2^+$ is obtained by removing one electron from $O_2$.

- $O_2$ has bond order = 2 (with 2 unpaired electrons in antibonding $\pi^*$ orbitals).
- $O_2^+$ loses one electron from an antibonding $\pi^*$ orbital.

$$\text{Bond order} = \frac{\text{Bonding electrons} - \text{Antibonding electrons}}{2} = \frac{10 - 5}{2} = 2.5$$

### Q3.
The geometry of $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$ ion is

(a) tetrahedral
(b) square planar
(c) octahedral
(d) linear

**Answer:** (b) square planar

**Solution:** In $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$, Ni is in the +2 oxidation state with electronic configuration $[\text{Ar}]3d^8$. CN⁻ is a strong field ligand that causes pairing of electrons, resulting in $dsp^2$ hybridisation. This gives a **square planar** geometry. The complex is diamagnetic.

---

### Q4.
Which among the following compounds exhibits enantiomerism?

(a) 1-Butanol
(b) 2-Butanol
(c) 2-Methyl-1-propanol
(d) Tert-butanol

**Answer:** (b) 2-Butanol

**Solution:** Enantiomerism requires a **chiral centre** (asymmetric carbon) — a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

- **2-Butanol** (CH₃–CH(OH)–CH₂–CH₃): The second carbon is bonded to –OH, –H, –CH₃, and –CH₂CH₃ (four different groups) → **chiral centre** → exhibits enantiomerism.
- 1-Butanol, 2-Methyl-1-propanol, and Tert-butanol lack a chiral centre.

---

### Q5.
The oxidation number of Fe in K₄[Fe(CN)₆] is

(a) 2
(b) 4
(c) 0
(d) 6

**Answer:** (a) 2

**Solution:** Let the oxidation state of Fe be $x$.

$$4(+1) + x + 6(-1) = 0$$
$$4 + x - 6 = 0$$
$$x = +2$$

The oxidation number of Fe in K₄[Fe(CN)₆] is **+2**.

---

### Q6.
Bakelite is obtained by the reaction between

(a) formaldehyde and phenol
(b) urea and formaldehyde
(c) butadiene and styrene
(d) ethylene and benzene

**Answer:** (a) formaldehyde and phenol

**Solution:** Bakelite is a thermosetting polymer formed by the **condensation polymerisation** of phenol and formaldehyde (methanal) in the presence of an acid or base catalyst. It forms a cross-linked 3D network structure.

$$\text{Phenol} + \text{Formaldehyde} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+ \text{ or OH}^-} \text{Bakelite} + H_2O$$

### Q7.
The rate constant of a first order reaction is $0.693\ \text{min}^{-1}$. Its half-life is

(a) 1.0 min
(b) 0.5 min
(c) 2.0 min
(d) 1.5 min

**Answer:** (a) 1.0 min

**Solution:** For a first-order reaction, the half-life is given by:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$$

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{0.693\ \text{min}^{-1}} = 1.0\ \text{min}$$

### Q8.
The main ore of aluminium is

(a) Magnetite
(b) Cuprite
(c) Cassiterite
(d) Bauxite

**Answer:** (d) Bauxite

**Solution:** The main ore of aluminium is **Bauxite** (Al₂O₃·2H₂O). Aluminium is extracted from bauxite by the Hall–Héroult process.

- Magnetite (Fe₃O₄) → Iron
- Cuprite (Cu₂O) → Copper
- Cassiterite (SnO₂) → Tin

---

### Q9.
Which ion shows maximum hydration energy?

(a) Na⁺
(b) Mg²⁺
(c) K⁺
(d) Ca²⁺

**Answer:** (b) Mg²⁺

**Solution:** Hydration energy is directly proportional to the **charge** of the ion and inversely proportional to its **ionic radius**. Mg²⁺ has:
- A higher charge (+2) compared to Na⁺ and K⁺ (+1).
- A smaller ionic radius compared to Ca²⁺.

Therefore, **Mg²⁺** has the maximum hydration energy among the given ions.

---

### Q10.
Which one of the following is a biodegradable polymer?

(a) Polystyrene
(b) PHBV
(c) PVC
(d) Bakelite

**Answer:** (b) PHBV

**Solution:** **PHBV** (Poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyrate-co-$\beta$-hydroxyvalerate) is a **biodegradable polymer** used in packaging and medical applications. It is produced by microorganisms and can be decomposed by bacteria in the environment. Polystyrene, PVC, and Bakelite are non-biodegradable.

---

### Q11.
The correct order of acidic strength of nitrophenols is

(a) ortho > para > meta
(b) para > ortho > meta
(c) meta > para > ortho
(d) ortho > meta > para

**Answer:** (a) ortho > para > meta

**Solution:** The acidic strength of nitrophenols depends on the ability of the –NO₂ group to stabilise the phenoxide ion through resonance and inductive effects.

- **ortho-nitrophenol**: –NO₂ group is adjacent to –OH; both inductive and resonance effects stabilise the phenoxide ion. Additionally, intramolecular hydrogen bonding reduces solvation but the net electron-withdrawing effect is strongest.
- **para-nitrophenol**: –NO₂ group stabilises phenoxide ion by resonance through the ring.
- **meta-nitrophenol**: –NO₂ group cannot stabilise by resonance; only inductive effect operates (weakest stabilisation).

Order: **ortho > para > meta**

### Q12.
Ammonia reacts with Cu²⁺ to give a deep blue coloured complex. This reaction is an example of:

(a) Redox reaction
(b) Precipitation reaction
(c) Complex formation
(d) Double displacement

**Answer:** (c) Complex formation

**Solution:** When excess NH₃ is added to a Cu²⁺ solution, a deep blue coloured complex ion $[\text{Cu(NH}_3)_4]^{2+}$ (tetraamminecopper(II)) is formed. NH₃ acts as a Lewis base (ligand) and donates lone pairs to Cu²⁺ (Lewis acid). This is a **complex formation** reaction.

$$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 4\text{NH}_3 \rightarrow [\text{Cu(NH}_3)_4]^{2+}$$

---

### Q13.
**Assertion (A):** Boiling point of water is higher than that of ammonia.

**Reason (R):** Water forms stronger hydrogen bonds than ammonia.

(a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
(b) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A.
(c) A is true, R is false.
(d) A is false, R is true.

**Answer:** (a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.

**Solution:**
- **Assertion** is true: Water boils at 100°C while ammonia boils at –33°C.
- **Reason** is true: Water (O–H···O) forms **stronger and more extensive hydrogen bonds** than ammonia (N–H···N) due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen and its two lone pairs, enabling a 3D hydrogen bond network.
- R correctly explains A: The stronger hydrogen bonds in water require more energy to break, hence the higher boiling point.

### Q14.
What is the IUPAC name of the following compound?

$$\text{CH}_3\text{–CH(OH)–CH}_2\text{–COOH}$$

(a) 3-Hydroxybutanoic acid
(b) 2-Hydroxybutanoic acid
(c) Butan-3-ol-1-oic acid
(d) 2-Hydroxypropanoic acid

**Answer:** (a) 3-Hydroxybutanoic acid

**Solution:** The longest carbon chain containing the –COOH group has **4 carbons** → parent chain: **butanoic acid**.

Numbering from the –COOH end:
- C-1: –COOH
- C-2: –CH₂–
- C-3: –CH(OH)– (hydroxyl substituent at position 3)
- C-4: –CH₃

IUPAC name: **3-Hydroxybutanoic acid**

---

### Q15.
Which of the following acts as an anticoagulant in blood?

(a) Vitamin K
(b) Heparin
(c) Insulin
(d) Thyroxin

**Answer:** (b) Heparin

**Solution:** **Heparin** is a naturally occurring polysaccharide (a glycosaminoglycan) that acts as an **anticoagulant** — it prevents blood clotting by inhibiting thrombin and other clotting factors. Note: Vitamin K promotes blood clotting (is a coagulant). Insulin regulates blood sugar; Thyroxin regulates metabolism.

---

### Q16.
The increasing order of basicity of the following is:

(a) Aniline < Ammonia < Ethylamine
(b) Ammonia < Aniline < Ethylamine
(c) Ethylamine < Aniline < Ammonia
(d) Aniline < Ethylamine < Ammonia

**Answer:** (a) Aniline < Ammonia < Ethylamine

**Solution:** Basicity depends on the availability of the lone pair on nitrogen:

- **Aniline**: The lone pair on N is delocalised into the benzene ring by resonance → least basic.
- **Ammonia**: No electron-donating alkyl group; moderate basicity.
- **Ethylamine** (C₂H₅NH₂): The ethyl group is electron-donating (+I effect), increasing the electron density on N → most basic (in gas phase and aqueous phase for primary aliphatic amines).

**Increasing order of basicity:** Aniline < Ammonia < Ethylamine

---

### Q17.
Which one among the following is a non-reducing sugar?

(a) Glucose
(b) Maltose
(c) Sucrose
(d) Lactose

**Answer:** (c) Sucrose

**Solution:** **Sucrose** is a **non-reducing sugar** because its anomeric carbon atoms of both glucose and fructose units are involved in the glycosidic linkage (1→2 linkage), leaving no free anomeric –OH group. Therefore, it cannot open to the aldehyde/keto form and cannot reduce Tollens' or Fehling's reagent. Glucose, Maltose, and Lactose are reducing sugars (they have free anomeric –OH groups).

---

### Q18.
The van't Hoff factor for a solution of K₂SO₄ in water is expected to be

(a) 1
(b) 2
(c) 3
(d) 4

**Answer:** (c) 3

**Solution:** K₂SO₄ is a strong electrolyte that dissociates completely in water:

$$\text{K}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow 2\text{K}^+ + \text{SO}_4^{2-}$$

1 formula unit produces **3 ions** (2 K⁺ + 1 SO₄²⁻).

$$i = \frac{\text{Total moles of particles after dissociation}}{\text{Moles of solute before dissociation}} = 3$$

---

### Q19.
The reaction of ethyl bromide with aqueous KOH produces

(a) Ethanol
(b) Ethene
(c) Acetylene
(d) Diethyl ether

**Answer:** (a) Ethanol

**Solution:** When ethyl bromide (C₂H₅Br) reacts with **aqueous KOH**, it undergoes **nucleophilic substitution (SN2)**:

$$\text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{Br} + \text{KOH (aq)} \rightarrow \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH} + \text{KBr}$$

The OH⁻ ion acts as a nucleophile and replaces Br⁻, giving **ethanol**.

> Note: Alcoholic KOH gives ethene (elimination), but aqueous KOH gives ethanol (substitution).

## Section B — Short Answer Questions (2 marks each)

### Q20.
Define F-centres. How does their presence affect the color of alkali halides?

**Answer:** F-centres are vacancies in the crystal lattice occupied by electrons; their presence imparts color to alkali halides.

**Solution:**
- **F-centres** (Farbe centres, from German for "colour") are **anion vacancies** in a crystal lattice that are **occupied by electrons** to maintain electrical neutrality.
- They are created when an alkali halide (e.g., NaCl) is heated in an atmosphere of its constituent alkali metal vapour (e.g., Na vapour). Extra Na atoms ionise; Na⁺ ions occupy lattice sites and the released electrons occupy anion vacancies.
- The trapped electrons can absorb visible light and get excited to higher energy levels. The complementary colour of the absorbed light is emitted/transmitted, imparting **colour** to the crystal.
  - E.g., NaCl heated in Na vapour → yellow colour; KCl heated in K vapour → violet colour.

---

### Q21.
Why does increasing the temperature generally increase the rate of a chemical reaction?

**Answer:** Increase in temperature raises kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more effective collisions and thus higher reaction rate.

**Solution:** Increasing temperature affects the reaction rate in two ways:
1. **Increased kinetic energy**: Molecules move faster, leading to a **greater frequency of collisions** per unit time.
2. **More molecules exceed activation energy**: As temperature rises, a larger fraction of molecules possess energy equal to or greater than the **activation energy (Eₐ)**, as described by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. These molecules can undergo **effective (fruitful) collisions**.

According to the **Arrhenius equation**:
$$k = A \cdot e^{-E_a/RT}$$

As $T$ increases, $e^{-E_a/RT}$ increases, so $k$ (rate constant) increases, and hence the reaction rate increases.

A rule of thumb: For every 10°C rise in temperature, the rate approximately **doubles**.

### Q22.
State Raoult's law for ideal solutions. Give one example of an ideal solution.

**Answer:** Raoult's law states that the partial vapour pressure of each component in an ideal solution is proportional to its mole fraction; example: benzene and toluene solution.

**Solution:**
**Raoult's Law:** For an ideal solution containing two volatile components A and B, the partial vapour pressure of each component is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the solution:

$$p_A = p_A^\circ \cdot x_A \quad \text{and} \quad p_B = p_B^\circ \cdot x_B$$

where $p_A^\circ$ and $p_B^\circ$ are the vapour pressures of pure A and B respectively, and $x_A$, $x_B$ are their mole fractions.

The total vapour pressure:
$$p_{\text{total}} = p_A + p_B = p_A^\circ x_A + p_B^\circ x_B$$

**Example of an ideal solution:** A solution of **benzene and toluene** (both are non-polar, similar in size and intermolecular forces, obey Raoult's law over the entire range of composition).

### Q23.
Write the cell reaction and calculate the EMF of the following cell at 25°C:

$$\text{Zn(s)}|\text{Zn}^{2+}(1\ \text{M})||\text{Cu}^{2+}(1\ \text{M})|\text{Cu(s)}$$

**Answer:** $\text{Zn(s)} + \text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + \text{Cu(s)}$; EMF ≈ 1.10 V.

**Solution:**

**Cell Reaction:**
- At **anode (oxidation):** $\text{Zn(s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + 2e^-$
- At **cathode (reduction):** $\text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu(s)}$
- **Overall:** $\text{Zn(s)} + \text{Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + \text{Cu(s)}$

**EMF Calculation:**

Using standard electrode potentials:
$$E^\circ_{\text{Cu}^{2+}/\text{Cu}} = +0.34\ \text{V}, \quad E^\circ_{\text{Zn}^{2+}/\text{Zn}} = -0.76\ \text{V}$$

$$E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} = +0.34 - (-0.76) = +1.10\ \text{V}$$

Since both concentrations are 1 M (standard conditions), by Nernst equation the EMF = $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ = **1.10 V**.

---

### Q24.
Explain why transition metals form colored compounds.

**Answer:** Transition metals form colored compounds due to d–d electron transitions when exposed to light.

**Solution:**
- Transition metals have **partially filled d-orbitals**.
- In the presence of ligands, the d-orbitals split into two sets of different energy levels (**crystal field splitting**): $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ (in an octahedral field).
- When visible light falls on a transition metal compound, electrons in the **lower energy d-orbitals** absorb photons of specific wavelength and are excited to **higher energy d-orbitals** — this is called a **d–d transition**.
- The **complementary colour** of the absorbed light is transmitted/reflected, giving the compound its characteristic colour.

**Example:** $[\text{Cu(H}_2\text{O)}_6]^{2+}$ absorbs red light and appears **blue**.

> Note: Zn²⁺ compounds are colourless because Zn²⁺ has a completely filled d¹⁰ configuration — no d–d transitions possible.

### Q25.
Give the equation for the preparation of acetaldehyde from ethanol. Name the catalyst used.

**Answer:** $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + [\text{O}] \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CHO} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$; catalyst: acidified K₂Cr₂O₇ or PCC.

**Solution:**

Acetaldehyde (ethanal) is prepared by the **oxidation of ethanol** (primary alcohol):

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{[\text{O}]} \text{CH}_3\text{CHO} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Catalysts/Oxidising agents used:**
- Acidified potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇/H₂SO₄)
- Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) — a mild oxidising agent that stops at the aldehyde stage.

The reaction involves removal of two hydrogen atoms (oxidation) from ethanol to form ethanal. Care must be taken to avoid over-oxidation to acetic acid (ethanoic acid).

### Q26.
Differentiate between thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers with suitable examples.

**Answer:** Thermoplastics soften on heating and can be reshaped; e.g. PVC. Thermosetting polymers harden permanently after moulding; e.g. Bakelite.

**Solution:**

| Property | Thermoplastic Polymers | Thermosetting Polymers |
|---|---|---|
| **Behaviour on heating** | Soften on heating; can be remoulded and reshaped | Harden permanently on heating; cannot be reshaped |
| **Structure** | Linear or slightly branched chains; held by weak van der Waals forces | Extensively cross-linked 3D network structure |
| **Recyclability** | Can be recycled | Cannot be recycled |
| **Solubility** | Soluble in suitable solvents | Insoluble in most solvents |
| **Examples** | Polyethylene, PVC, Polystyrene, Nylon | Bakelite, Melamine, Urea-formaldehyde resin |

---

### Q27.
How does the presence of non-volatile solute affect the boiling point of a solvent? Name this phenomenon.

**Answer:** Boiling point of solvent increases due to non-volatile solute; this is called elevation of boiling point.

**Solution:**
- When a **non-volatile solute** is dissolved in a solvent, the **vapour pressure of the solvent decreases** (as given by Raoult's law, since $x_{\text{solvent}} < 1$).
- A liquid boils when its vapour pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Since the vapour pressure is lowered, a **higher temperature** is needed to reach atmospheric pressure.
- Therefore, the **boiling point of the solution is higher** than that of the pure solvent.

**This phenomenon is called:** Elevation of Boiling Point (Ebullioscopy).

The mathematical relation:
$$\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m$$

where $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant and $m$ is the molality of the solution.

---

### Q28.
Although NH₃ has higher molar mass than PH₃, it has lower boiling point. Explain.

**Answer:** NH₃ forms strong hydrogen bonds, but has lower boiling point than PH₃ due to greater molecular interactions in PH₃.

> **Note:** There is an error in the answer key. The correct explanation is the opposite — NH₃ has a **higher** boiling point than PH₃ due to hydrogen bonding.

**Correct Solution:**
- **NH₃** (boiling point: –33°C) forms **strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds** (N–H···N) due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen and the presence of a lone pair. This requires significantly more energy to overcome.
- **PH₃** (boiling point: –87°C) **cannot form hydrogen bonds** because phosphorus is not electronegative enough. It is held together only by weak **van der Waals forces**.
- Despite having a higher molar mass (and thus stronger London dispersion forces), PH₃ has a **lower boiling point** than NH₃ because hydrogen bonding in NH₃ is a much stronger intermolecular force.

Therefore: **NH₃ has a higher boiling point than PH₃**, not lower.

---

### Q29.
Write the relation between Gibbs energy and cell potential for an electrochemical cell.

**Answer:** $\Delta G = -nFE_{\text{cell}}$ relates Gibbs energy and cell potential.

**Solution:**

The relationship between Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) and cell potential ($E_{\text{cell}}$) is:

$$\boxed{\Delta G = -nFE_{\text{cell}}}$$

Where:
- $\Delta G$ = Gibbs free energy change (in joules)
- $n$ = number of moles of electrons transferred in the cell reaction
- $F$ = Faraday's constant ($= 96485\ \text{C mol}^{-1} \approx 96500\ \text{C mol}^{-1}$)
- $E_{\text{cell}}$ = EMF of the cell (in volts)

For **standard conditions**:
$$\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ_{\text{cell}}$$

- If $E_{\text{cell}} > 0$, then $\Delta G < 0$ → reaction is **spontaneous**.
- If $E_{\text{cell}} < 0$, then $\Delta G > 0$ → reaction is **non-spontaneous**.

---

### Q30.
The rate equation for a reaction is: $\text{rate} = k[\text{A}]^1[\text{B}]^2$. What is the order of the reaction?

**Answer:** Order of the reaction is $1 + 2 = 3$.

**Solution:**

Given rate law: $\text{rate} = k[\text{A}]^1[\text{B}]^2$

- Order with respect to A = **1**
- Order with respect to B = **2**
- **Overall order** = sum of all exponents = $1 + 2 = \mathbf{3}$

The reaction is a **third-order reaction**. The unit of rate constant $k$ for a third-order reaction is $\text{L}^2\ \text{mol}^{-2}\ \text{s}^{-1}$.

### Q31.
Write one example each of synthetic and natural polymers.

**Answer:** Synthetic polymer: Nylon; Natural polymer: Cellulose.

**Solution:**

- **Synthetic Polymer:** A polymer that is man-made/artificially synthesised.
  - **Example: Nylon-6,6** — formed by condensation polymerisation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid. Used in making fabrics, ropes, and gears.

- **Natural Polymer:** A polymer that occurs naturally in living organisms.
  - **Example: Cellulose** — a polysaccharide made of β-D-glucose units linked by 1,4-glycosidic bonds. Forms the cell walls of plants.

Other examples:
- Synthetic: Polythene, PVC, Bakelite, Terylene
- Natural: Starch, Natural rubber (polyisoprene), Proteins, Nucleic acids

---

### Q32.
Give the IUPAC name for $(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{CNH}_2$.

**Answer:** 2-Amino-2-methylpropane.

**Solution:**

Structure of $(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{CNH}_2$:
- Central carbon bonded to three –CH₃ groups and one –NH₂ group.
- Total carbons = 4 → parent chain: **propane** (longest chain with –NH₂ = butane? Let's recount)

The compound is **tert-butylamine**:
- Longest chain containing the carbon bearing –NH₂: The central carbon + one methyl = **butane** (4 carbons with –NH₂ at position 2).

Actually, considering the full structure: C(CH₃)₃–NH₂:
- Longest chain = 4 carbons → **but-2-amine** would not work. The –NH₂ is on carbon 2 of a butane chain with a methyl branch... 

Correct analysis:
- Parent chain = **propane** (3C) with –NH₂ at C-1 and a methyl at C-1? No.
- Best: parent chain = **butane** is not possible without branching being named.

**IUPAC Name: 2-methylpropan-2-amine** (or **2-amino-2-methylpropane**)

- Parent: propane (3C chain)
- At C-2: methyl group and amino group
- Name: **2-methylpropan-2-amine**

---

### Q33.
Explain the difference between competitive and non-competitive enzyme inhibition.

**Answer:** Competitive inhibition: inhibitor competes with substrate for active site; non-competitive inhibition: inhibitor binds elsewhere, changing enzyme shape.

**Solution:**

| Feature | Competitive Inhibition | Non-Competitive Inhibition |
|---|---|---|
| **Site of binding** | Inhibitor binds to the **active site** of the enzyme | Inhibitor binds to an **allosteric site** (different from active site) |
| **Mechanism** | Inhibitor **competes** with the substrate for the same active site | Inhibitor changes the **conformation** of the enzyme, reducing its catalytic activity |
| **Effect of increasing substrate** | Can be **overcome** by increasing substrate concentration | **Cannot** be overcome by increasing substrate concentration |
| **Vmax** | Vmax remains the same (at high substrate) | Vmax decreases |
| **Km** | Apparent Km increases | Km remains unchanged |
| **Example** | Malonate inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase | Heavy metal ions inhibiting enzymes |

### Q34.
Why is potassium permanganate considered a self-indicator in redox titrations?

**Answer:** KMnO₄ acts as its own indicator by changing colour as it reacts and is reduced in redox titrations.

**Solution:**
- KMnO₄ (potassium permanganate) is an intensely **purple/violet coloured** compound.
- In acidic medium, it acts as a strong oxidising agent and gets **reduced to Mn²⁺** (which is nearly **colourless** in dilute solution):

$$\text{MnO}_4^- + 8\text{H}^+ + 5e^- \rightarrow \text{Mn}^{2+} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

- During the titration, as long as the reducing agent (e.g., Fe²⁺, oxalic acid) is present, the purple colour of KMnO₄ is immediately **discharged** (becomes colourless).
- At the **end point**, when the reducing agent is completely consumed, the addition of even one extra drop of KMnO₄ imparts a **permanent pale pink/violet colour** to the solution.
- Since KMnO₄ itself signals the end point through its colour change, **no separate indicator is needed** — it is called a **self-indicator**.

### Q35.
Write two differences between lyophilic and lyophobic sols.

**Answer:** Lyophilic sols are easily prepared and reversible; lyophobic sols are not, and irreversible.

**Solution:**

| Property | Lyophilic Sols | Lyophobic Sols |
|---|---|---|
| **Meaning** | "Solvent-loving" — dispersed phase has strong affinity for the dispersion medium | "Solvent-hating" — dispersed phase has little or no affinity for the dispersion medium |
| **Preparation** | Easily prepared by simply dissolving/dispersing | Prepared by special methods (arc method, peptisation); not formed spontaneously |
| **Stability** | More stable; not easily coagulated | Less stable; easily coagulated by adding electrolytes |
| **Reversibility** | **Reversible** — can be converted back to sol from precipitate | **Irreversible** — once coagulated, cannot be easily redispersed |
| **Examples** | Starch, gelatin, gum, protein sols | Gold sol, As₂S₃ sol, Fe(OH)₃ sol |

### Q36.
State the function of DNA in the synthesis of proteins.

**Answer:** DNA carries genetic information and serves as a template for protein synthesis via transcription and translation.

**Solution:**
DNA plays a central role in protein synthesis through two main processes:

1. **Transcription:** The double-stranded DNA unwinds and one strand serves as a **template** for the synthesis of **messenger RNA (mRNA)** by RNA polymerase. The mRNA sequence is complementary to the DNA template strand.

2. **Translation:** The mRNA moves to the **ribosome**, where it is read in **codons** (triplets of nucleotide bases). **Transfer RNA (tRNA)** molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome and match anticodons with mRNA codons. Amino acids are joined by **peptide bonds** to form the **polypeptide chain (protein)**.

In summary: **DNA → (Transcription) → mRNA → (Translation) → Protein**

The sequence of bases in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein, following the **central dogma of molecular biology**.

- –NO₂ at C-4 (para)

It is a yellow crystalline solid and is more acidic than phenol due to the electron-withdrawing –NO₂ groups.

### Q38.
What are semiconductors? Give one example.

**Answer:** Semiconductors have conductivity between metals and insulators; e.g. silicon.

**Solution:**
**Semiconductors** are substances whose electrical conductivity lies **between that of conductors (metals) and insulators**. Their conductivity typically ranges from $10^{-6}$ to $10^4\ \text{S m}^{-1}$.

**Characteristics:**
- Have a **small band gap** between the valence band and the conduction band (typically 0.1–3 eV).
- At absolute zero, they behave as insulators.
- At higher temperatures, some electrons gain enough energy to jump to the conduction band, increasing conductivity.
- Conductivity **increases with temperature** (unlike metals).

**Types:**
- **Intrinsic semiconductors:** Pure semiconductors (e.g., Si, Ge).
- **Extrinsic semiconductors:** Doped with impurities to enhance conductivity (n-type with group 15 elements; p-type with group 13 elements).

**Example:** **Silicon (Si)** — used extensively in solar cells, transistors, and integrated circuits.

### Q39.
Arrange the following in increasing order of bond length: N₂, O₂, F₂

**Answer:** $\text{N}_2 < \text{O}_2 < \text{F}_2$

**Solution:**

Bond length is inversely related to **bond order** (higher bond order = shorter, stronger bond):

| Molecule | Bond Order | Bond Length |
|---|---|---|
| N₂ | 3 (triple bond) | 110 pm |
| O₂ | 2 (double bond) | 121 pm |
| F₂ | 1 (single bond) | 144 pm |

**Increasing order of bond length:** $\text{N}_2 < \text{O}_2 < \text{F}_2$

As bond order decreases from N₂ (3) to O₂ (2) to F₂ (1), the bond length increases.

### Q40.
Describe the steps involved in the extraction of copper from its sulphide ore.

**Answer:** Copper extraction: Ore is concentrated, roasted to oxide, then reduced using carbon; blister copper obtained by refining.

**Solution:**

The main ore of copper is **copper pyrite (CuFeS₂)**. The extraction involves the following steps:

**Step 1: Concentration of Ore**
The ore is crushed and concentrated by the **froth flotation method**, which separates the sulphide ore from gangue (silica, etc.).

**Step 2: Roasting**
The concentrated ore is roasted in a furnace to convert sulphides to oxides:
$$2\text{CuFeS}_2 + O_2 \rightarrow \text{Cu}_2\text{S} + 2\text{FeS} + \text{SO}_2$$

**Step 3: Smelting (Reduction)**
The roasted ore is mixed with coke and silica (SiO₂) and smelted in a blast furnace. FeO combines with SiO₂ to form slag (FeSiO₃), which is removed. The remaining Cu₂S is converted to **blister copper**:

$$2\text{Cu}_2\text{S} + 3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Cu}_2\text{O} + 2\text{SO}_2$$
$$2\text{Cu}_2\text{O} + \text{Cu}_2\text{S} \rightarrow 6\text{Cu} + \text{SO}_2$$

The copper obtained is called **blister copper** (~98% pure) due to its blistered surface from SO₂ gas.

**Step 4: Refining**
Blister copper is purified by **electrolytic refining**:
- Anode: Impure copper (blister copper)
- Cathode: Pure copper strip
- Electrolyte: Acidified CuSO₄ solution
- Pure copper deposits at cathode; impurities collect as **anode mud**.

### Q41.
Give the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reaction of methyl bromide with aqueous sodium hydroxide.

**Answer:** Methyl bromide reacts with NaOH via S_N2 mechanism, forming methanol and NaBr; involves one-step nucleophilic attack.

**Solution:**

The reaction of methyl bromide (CH₃Br) with aqueous NaOH proceeds via the **S_N2 (Bimolecular Nucleophilic Substitution) mechanism**:

**Overall Reaction:**
$$\text{CH}_3\text{Br} + \text{NaOH (aq)} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{NaBr}$$

**Mechanism (Single-step, concerted):**

1. **Nucleophile:** OH⁻ (strong nucleophile from NaOH) attacks the **electrophilic carbon** (carbon bearing the leaving group Br⁻) from the **back side** (180° to the C–Br bond).

2. **Transition State:** A trigonal bipyramidal transition state is formed where the carbon is simultaneously bonded to OH⁻ (partially) and Br⁻ (partially):

[Diagram: Transition state showing HO⁻ attacking the carbon from one side while Br⁻ is leaving from the other side; carbon has a partial negative charge, shown as [HO---CH₃---Br]⁻ with the three remaining H atoms arranged in a plane]

$$\text{HO}^- + \text{CH}_3\text{Br} \rightarrow [\delta^-\text{HO}---\text{CH}_3---\text{Br}^{\delta^-}]^\ddagger \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{OH} + \text{Br}^-$$

3. **Inversion of configuration** (Walden inversion) occurs at the carbon centre.

4. **Rate law:** Rate = $k[\text{CH}_3\text{Br}][\text{OH}^-]$ → **second-order kinetics** (bimolecular).

For CH₃Br, only S_N2 occurs (no tertiary carbon, no carbocation stabilisation, so S_N1 is not possible).

### Q42.
How will you distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols using Lucas reagent?

**Answer:** Lucas test: Primary alcohols react slowly, secondary – moderately fast, tertiary – immediately with Lucas reagent, forming turbidity at different rates.

**Solution:**

**Lucas Reagent:** A mixture of **concentrated HCl and anhydrous ZnCl₂**.

**Principle:** Lucas reagent converts alcohols to alkyl chlorides (which are insoluble in the reagent), producing **turbidity** (cloudiness). The reaction proceeds via carbocation formation (S_N1 mechanism), so the reactivity order depends on carbocation stability.

$$\text{R–OH} + \text{HCl} \xrightarrow{\text{ZnCl}_2} \text{R–Cl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Results:**

| Alcohol | Observation | Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Tertiary alcohol** (e.g., (CH₃)₃COH) | **Immediate turbidity** (solution turns cloudy at once) | Instantaneous |
| **Secondary alcohol** (e.g., (CH₃)₂CHOH) | Turbidity appears **within 5 minutes** | Within 5 min |
| **Primary alcohol** (e.g., CH₃CH₂OH) | **No turbidity** at room temperature; reacts only on heating | No reaction at RT |

**Explanation:**
- Tertiary carbocations form most easily → fastest reaction.
- Secondary carbocations form less easily → moderate rate.
- Primary alcohols cannot easily form primary carbocations → no turbidity at room temperature.

### Q43.
Explain the lanthanide contraction and its consequences.

**Answer:** Lanthanide contraction is the gradual decrease in ionic radius among lanthanides; causes similarities between 4d and 5d transition series.

**Solution:**

**Lanthanide Contraction:**
- As we move across the lanthanide series (Ce to Lu, Z = 58–71), each element adds one electron to the **4f orbitals** while the nuclear charge increases by 1.
- The **4f electrons** have poor shielding effect (due to diffuse and poorly shielding f-orbitals).
- As a result, the effective nuclear charge felt by the outer electrons increases progressively.
- This causes a **gradual but steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii** across the lanthanide series.
- This phenomenon is called **lanthanide contraction**.

**Consequences of Lanthanide Contraction:**

1. **Similarity between 4d and 5d transition series elements:**
   - The contraction in lanthanide series nearly offsets the expected increase in atomic radii going from 4d to 5d elements.
   - This makes pairs like Zr–Hf, Nb–Ta, Mo–W nearly identical in size, making their **separation very difficult**.

2. **Basicity of lanthanide hydroxides:**
   - As ionic radius decreases across the series, the covalent character of M–OH bond increases, and basicity of $\text{Ln(OH)}_3$ **decreases** from La(OH)₃ to Lu(OH)₃.

3. **Stability of complexes:**
   - Smaller lanthanide ions form **more stable complexes** due to higher charge density.

### Q44.
Explain the principle and process of froth flotation method used for concentration of ore.

**Answer:** Froth flotation involves mixing crushed ore with oil and water; air bubbles lift ore particles to surface for collection.

**Solution:**

**Principle:**
Froth flotation is based on the **difference in the wettability** of ore particles and gangue by water.
- **Ore particles** (sulphide ores) are preferentially wetted by **oil** (hydrophobic) and not by water.
- **Gangue particles** are preferentially wetted by **water** (hydrophilic) and not by oil.

**Process:**

1. The finely powdered ore is added to a large tank containing **water and pine oil** (or other collectors like xanthates).

2. A vigorous current of **air** is blown through the mixture to create **froth/foam**.

3. The **oil-coated ore particles** (sulphide ore) attach to the air bubbles and rise to the surface with the froth.

4. The **gangue particles** settle to the bottom (they are wetted by water and are heavier).

5. The froth carrying ore particles is **skimmed off**, and the ore is filtered and dried.

**Depressants:** Chemicals like NaCN or starch can be used to selectively depress certain minerals (e.g., ZnS) while allowing others (PbS) to float, enabling **selective separation**.

**Application:** Particularly useful for **sulphide ores** like galena (PbS), copper pyrite (CuFeS₂), zinc blende (ZnS).

### Q45.
Describe the importance of green chemistry in chemical synthesis.

**Answer:** Green chemistry aims to minimise environmental impact by designing safer chemicals and reducing waste in synthesis.

**Solution:**

**Green Chemistry** is defined as the design of chemical products and processes that **reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances**. It was developed by Paul Anastas and John Warner.

**Importance of Green Chemistry in Chemical Synthesis:**

1. **Prevention of waste:** Designing syntheses that generate little or no waste, avoiding end-of-pipe treatment.

2. **Atom economy:** Maximising the incorporation of all starting materials into the final product (100% atom utilisation).

3. **Safer chemicals:** Designing chemical products that are fully effective yet have little or no toxicity to living organisms.

4. **Safer solvents:** Replacing hazardous solvents with safer alternatives (e.g., water as a reaction medium, supercritical CO₂).

5. **Energy efficiency:** Conducting reactions at ambient temperature and pressure to reduce energy consumption.

6. **Renewable feedstocks:** Using raw materials derived from renewable resources (biomass) rather than petroleum.

7. **Catalysis:** Using catalytic reagents (in small amounts, selective) rather than stoichiometric reagents.

8. **Reducing derivatives:** Minimising the use of protecting groups that require additional reagents.

**Examples:**
- Use of H₂O₂ instead of Cl₂ as an oxidising agent in bleaching.
- Use of bio-catalysts (enzymes) for stereoselective synthesis.

### Q46.
What is the difference between order and molecularity of a reaction? Give an example for each.

**Answer:** Order is the sum of powers of concentration in the rate law; molecularity refers to the number of reactant molecules in an elementary step.

**Solution:**

| Feature | Order of Reaction | Molecularity of Reaction |
|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | Sum of the exponents (powers) of concentration terms in the experimentally determined rate law | Number of reactant molecules/atoms/ions that collide simultaneously in an **elementary step** |
| **Determined by** | **Experimentally** (from rate law) | **Theoretically** (from the mechanism/elementary step) |
| **Value** | Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or even a fraction; can be negative | Always a **positive integer** (1, 2, or 3); never zero or fraction |
| **Applicable to** | Overall reactions as well as elementary steps | Only **elementary reactions** (single-step) |
| **Can change?** | Can change with conditions (e.g., pseudo first-order) | Fixed for an elementary step; cannot change |

**Example for Order:**
- Decomposition of H₂O₂: rate = $k[\text{H}_2\text{O}_2]^1$ → **First order**
- $\text{rate} = k[\text{A}]^{3/2}$ → **Order = 3/2** (fractional order)

**Example for Molecularity:**
- $\text{NO}_2\text{Cl} \rightarrow \text{NO}_2 + \text{Cl}$ → **Unimolecular** (1 molecule involved)
- $\text{H}_2 + \text{I}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HI}$ → **Bimolecular** (2 molecules collide)
- $2\text{NO} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NO}_2$ → **Termolecular** (3 molecules collide)

### Q47.
Explain the term 'peptide bond' with the help of a diagram.

**Answer:** A peptide bond is formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing water; –CO–NH–.

**Solution:**

**Peptide Bond:**
A **peptide bond** (also called an amide bond) is a **covalent chemical bond** formed between the **carboxyl group (–COOH)** of one amino acid and the **amino group (–NH₂)** of another amino acid, with the **elimination of a water molecule** (condensation reaction).

**Formation:**

$$\text{H}_2\text{N–CHR}_1\text{–COOH} + \text{H}_2\text{N–CHR}_2\text{–COOH} \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{N–CHR}_1\text{–CO–NH–CHR}_2\text{–COOH} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

[Diagram: Two amino acid molecules shown side by side. Amino acid 1 has H₂N–CHR₁–COOH structure. Amino acid 2 has H₂N–CHR₂–COOH structure. An arrow shows elimination of H₂O between the –COOH of amino acid 1 and –NH₂ of amino acid 2, forming a dipeptide H₂N–CHR₁–**CO–NH**–CHR₂–COOH. The peptide bond –CO–NH– is highlighted/boxed.]

**Key Features:**
- The peptide bond (–**CO–NH**–) has **partial double bond character** due to resonance.
- The peptide bond is **planar** and **rigid**.
- Proteins are formed by many amino acids linked by peptide bonds forming a **polypeptide chain**.

### Q48.
Mention the main postulates of the valence bond theory as applied to transition metal complexes.

**Answer:** Valence bond theory postulates hybridisation of orbitals, formation of coordinate bonds, and predicts geometry of complexes.

**Solution:**

The **Valence Bond Theory (VBT)** of coordination compounds was developed by Linus Pauling. Main postulates:

1. **Hybridisation:** The central metal atom/ion uses a definite set of **hybrid orbitals** (formed from atomic orbitals) to form bonds with ligands. The type of hybridisation determines the **geometry** of the complex.

2. **Coordinate Bond Formation:** Ligands donate **lone pairs of electrons** to the empty hybrid orbitals of the metal, forming **coordinate (dative) covalent bonds**. The metal acts as a Lewis acid and ligands act as Lewis bases.

3. **Inner and Outer Orbital Complexes:**
   - **Inner orbital complexes** (low-spin): Use inner (n–1)d orbitals for hybridisation → formed with **strong field ligands**.
   - **Outer orbital complexes** (high-spin): Use outer nd orbitals for hybridisation → formed with **weak field ligands**.

4. **Magnetic Properties:** The magnetic nature of complexes is predicted from the number of **unpaired electrons** in the metal ion after hybridisation.
   - Complexes with unpaired electrons → **paramagnetic**.
   - Complexes with all electrons paired → **diamagnetic**.

5. **Geometry from Hybridisation:**

| Hybridisation | Geometry |
|---|---|
| $sp^3$ | Tetrahedral |
| $dsp^2$ | Square planar |
| $sp^3d^2$ or $d^2sp^3$ | Octahedral |

**Example:** $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$: Ni²⁺ ($3d^8$) undergoes $dsp^2$ hybridisation with CN⁻ (strong field) → **square planar**, **diamagnetic**.

### Q49.
Write the chemical equations involved in the reaction of glucose with: (i) bromine water, (ii) HI.

**Answer:** (i) Glucose + Br₂ → Gluconic acid (ii) Glucose + HI → n-Hexane.

**Solution:**

**(i) Reaction of Glucose with Bromine Water:**
Bromine water is a mild oxidising agent. It **oxidises the aldehyde group (–CHO)** of glucose (an aldose) to a **carboxylic acid group (–COOH)**, giving **gluconic acid**:

$$\text{C}_5\text{H}_{11}\text{O}_5\text{CHO} + \text{Br}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{C}_5\text{H}_{11}\text{O}_5\text{COOH} + 2\text{HBr}$$

$$\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{Br}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}} \text{Gluconic acid}$$

This reaction also serves as a **test to confirm the aldehyde group** in glucose (bromine water is decolourised).

**(ii) Reaction of Glucose with HI:**
Concentrated HI is a **strong reducing agent** that reduces all the –OH groups in glucose stepwise:

$$\text{C}_5\text{H}_{11}\text{O}_5\text{CHO} \xrightarrow{\text{HI}} \text{n-Hexane (CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{)}$$

The reaction proceeds via reduction of –OH groups and the –CHO group, ultimately giving **n-hexane**. This confirmed that glucose has a straight-chain structure with 6 carbon atoms.

$$\text{Glucose (}C_6H_{12}O_6\text{)} + \text{excess HI} \rightarrow \text{n-Hexane (}C_6H_{14}\text{)} + \text{HI/H}_2\text{O products}$$

## Section D — Case Study / Source-Based Questions

### Q50.
**Read the passage and answer the questions:**

A student dissolves sodium chloride in water, cools the solution, and observes some white powder precipitating out. She filters and collects this powder, also measuring the conductivity before and after precipitation.

**(a) Why does precipitation of sodium chloride occur upon cooling?**

**(b) How will conductivity change after precipitation and why?**

**Answer:**
(a) Solubility of NaCl decreases on cooling, causing precipitation.
(b) Conductivity decreases because fewer ions remain in solution after precipitation.

**Solution:**

**(a) Precipitation upon cooling:**
- The **solubility of NaCl in water** is dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, more NaCl dissolves (higher solubility).
- When a **saturated solution** of NaCl is cooled, its solubility decreases — the solution becomes **supersaturated**.
- To restore equilibrium, the **excess NaCl crystallises out** (precipitates) as white solid crystals.
- This is the principle behind **fractional crystallisation** used for purification of salts.

**(b) Change in conductivity:**
- **Conductivity decreases** after precipitation.
- **Reason:** The electrical conductivity of an ionic solution depends on the **concentration of ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻)** present in solution.
- When NaCl precipitates out, some Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are removed from the solution and form the solid lattice.
- Fewer ions in solution → **lower ionic concentration** → **reduced conductivity**.
- The relationship: Conductivity $\propto$ number of ions in solution.

### Q51.
The following data were recorded for the reaction: $2\text{NO}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{NO} + \text{O}_2$

| Initial $[\text{NO}_2]$ (M) | Initial Rate (mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹) |
|---|---|
| 0.5 | $1.0 \times 10^{-2}$ |
| 1.0 | $4.0 \times 10^{-2}$ |

**(a) Determine the order of the reaction with respect to NO₂.**

**(b) Explain why the rate changes as observed.**

**Answer:**
(a) Order is 2; rate quadruples when [NO₂] doubles.
(b) The rate increases as concentration increases due to dependence on the second power of reactant.

**Solution:**

**(a) Determination of Order:**

Let the rate law be: $\text{rate} = k[\text{NO}_2]^n$

Using the two sets of data:
$$\frac{\text{Rate}_2}{\text{Rate}_1} = \left(\frac{[\text{NO}_2]_2}{[\text{NO}_2]_1}\right)^n$$

$$\frac{4.0 \times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \times 10^{-2}} = \left(\frac{1.0}{0.5}\right)^n$$

$$4 = (2)^n$$

$$2^n = 4 = 2^2 \implies n = 2$$

**The reaction is second order with respect to NO₂.**

**(b) Explanation of rate change:**
- When the concentration of NO₂ is **doubled** (from 0.5 M to 1.0 M), the rate **quadruples** (from $1.0 \times 10^{-2}$ to $4.0 \times 10^{-2}$ mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹).
- This is because the rate is proportional to $[\text{NO}_2]^2$ (second-order dependence).
- Doubling the concentration: Rate increases by $2^2 = 4$ times.
- At higher concentrations, there are **more NO₂ molecules** available per unit volume, leading to a **much greater frequency of effective collisions** between reactant molecules, hence a significantly higher reaction rate.

### Q52.
After adding excess NaOH to an unknown metal salt solution, a reddish-brown precipitate forms. Upon adding NH₄Cl, the precipitate dissolves.

**(a) Which metal ion is likely present and why?**

**(b) What is the role of NH₄Cl in dissolving the precipitate?**

**Answer:**
(a) The ion is likely Fe³⁺; reddish-brown precipitate indicates ferric hydroxide.
(b) NH₄Cl dissolves the precipitate by shifting equilibrium and preventing hydrolysis.

**Solution:**

**(a) Identification of metal ion:**
- A **reddish-brown precipitate** formed with excess NaOH is characteristic of **ferric hydroxide Fe(OH)₃**.
- The metal ion present is **Fe³⁺** (iron(III) ion / ferric ion).

$$\text{Fe}^{3+}\text{(aq)} + 3\text{NaOH (aq)} \rightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3\downarrow \text{(reddish-brown)} + 3\text{Na}^+$$

- Fe(OH)₃ is a gelatinous reddish-brown precipitate that is insoluble in excess NaOH (unlike Al(OH)₃ which dissolves in excess NaOH to form aluminate).

**(b) Role of NH₄Cl in dissolving the precipitate:**
- NH₄Cl is an **acidic salt** — it provides NH₄⁺ ions which are mildly acidic (conjugate acid of weak base NH₃).
- Adding NH₄Cl **lowers the pH** of the solution by neutralising excess OH⁻:

$$\text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

- This **reduces the hydroxide ion concentration**, shifting the equilibrium:

$$\text{Fe(OH)}_3 \rightleftharpoons \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{OH}^-$$

- The equilibrium shifts to the **right**, dissolving the precipitate.
- NH₄Cl essentially **counteracts the excess NaOH** by consuming OH⁻ ions, thereby dissolving the Fe(OH)₃ precipitate.

## Section E — Long Answer Questions (5 marks each)

### Q53.
Discuss the principle, working, and applications of the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. Also explain the reactions at both electrodes and the industrial significance of this process.

**Answer:** Electrolysis of molten NaCl involves Na⁺ reduced to Na at cathode, Cl⁻ oxidised to Cl₂ at anode; used industrially for sodium and chlorine production.

**Solution:**

**Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride (Down's Process):**

**Principle:**
Electrolysis is the process of **decomposing an electrolyte** by passing an electric current through it in the molten/dissolved state. In molten NaCl, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are free to move and can be discharged at respective electrodes.

**Dissociation of NaCl (in molten state):**
$$\text{NaCl} \rightarrow \text{Na}^+ + \text{Cl}^-$$

**Working:**
- **Setup (Down's Cell):** A cylindrical steel cell with a **carbon (graphite) anode** and a **steel cathode** (ring-shaped). A diaphragm (iron gauze) separates the products to prevent recombination.
- Molten NaCl (m.p. 801°C) is taken; CaCl₂ is often added to lower the melting point.
- Direct current (DC) is passed through molten NaCl.

**Electrode Reactions:**

**At Cathode (reduction):**
$$\text{Na}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Na (l)}$$

$$\text{(Sodium metal is deposited as liquid, collected)}$$

**At Anode (oxidation):**
$$2\text{Cl}^- \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2\text{(g)} + 2e^-$$

$$\text{(Chlorine gas is evolved at the anode)}$$

**Overall Cell Reaction:**
