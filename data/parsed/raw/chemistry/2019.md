## Section A — 1 Mark Each

### Q1.
Out of NaCl and AgCl, which one shows Frenkel defect and why?

**Answer:** AgCl shows Frenkel defect.

**Solution:**
The Frenkel defect is one in which a smaller ion (usually a cation) moves from its lattice position to an interstitial site (a tetrahedral or octahedral hole), creating a vacancy in the lattice.

- **AgCl** shows this defect because the size of Ag⁺ cation is small enough to move into interstitial spaces.
- **NaCl** (an alkali metal halide) does **not** show this defect because the Na⁺ cation is relatively larger and cannot fit into the interstitial voids.

### Q2.
Arrange the following in increasing order of boiling points:

$$(CH_3)_3N, \quad C_2H_5OH, \quad C_2H_5NH_2$$

**Answer:** $(CH_3)_3N < C_2H_5NH_2 < C_2H_5OH$

**Solution:**
The increasing order of boiling points can be explained by intermolecular hydrogen bonding:

- **$(CH_3)_3N$** (Trimethylamine) — Tertiary amine; cannot engage in hydrogen bonding as there is no N–H bond. Lowest boiling point.
- **$C_2H_5NH_2$** (Ethylamine) — Primary amine; undergoes intermolecular hydrogen bonding via N–H. Higher boiling point than tertiary amine.
- **$C_2H_5OH$** (Ethanol) — Alcohol; undergoes stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to the higher electronegativity of oxygen compared to nitrogen. Highest boiling point.

$$\boxed{(CH_3)_3N < C_2H_5NH_2 < C_2H_5OH}$$

### Q3.
Why are medicines more effective in colloidal state?

**Answer:**
Medicines in colloidal form are easily absorbed by body tissues due to the very large surface area of colloidal particles. This results in greater bioavailability and effectiveness.

*Example:* Antibiotics like streptomycin in the form of a colloidal sol are injected into the body for more effective results.

**OR**

What is the difference between an emulsion and a gel?

**Answer:**

| Property | Emulsion | Gel |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Definition** | A colloidal mixture in which both the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium are **liquids** | A colloid in which a **liquid** (dispersed phase) is combined with a **solid** (dispersion medium) to produce a semisolid material |
| **Example** | Milk | Jellies |

### Q4.
Define ambident nucleophile with an example.

**Answer:**
An **ambident nucleophile** is an anionic nucleophile that has **two nucleophilic centres** (two sites with negative charge). The negative charge is delocalized due to resonance, allowing the nucleophile to attack from either site.

**Examples:**

- **Cyanide ion** ($CN^-$):
$$\overset{\ominus}{C} \equiv N \longleftrightarrow C = \overset{\ominus}{N}$$

- **Thiocyanate ion** ($SCN^-$):
$$S = C = \overset{\ominus}{N} \longleftrightarrow \overset{\ominus}{S} - C \equiv N$$

Both carbon and nitrogen (in cyanide) and both sulfur and nitrogen (in thiocyanate) can act as nucleophilic centres.

### Q5.
What is the basic structural difference between glucose and fructose?

**Answer:**
Both glucose and fructose are **hexose sugars** with six carbon atoms, but they differ in their functional groups:

- **Glucose** is an **aldohexose** — contains an **aldehyde** (–CHO) functional group at C-1.
- **Fructose** is a **ketohexose** — contains a **ketone** (C=O) functional group at C-2.

[Diagram: Open chain structures of D-fructose (ketohexose, C=O at C-2) and D-glucose (aldohexose, CHO at C-1) shown side by side with all –OH and –H groups on each carbon]

**OR**

Write the products obtained after hydrolysis of lactose.

**Answer:**
Lactose is a disaccharide composed of $\beta$-D-galactose and $\beta$-D-glucose linked by a glycosidic bond. On hydrolysis:

$$C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + H_2O \longrightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + C_6H_{12}O_6$$

$$\text{Lactose} + \text{Water} \longrightarrow \text{D-Glucose} + \text{D-Galactose}$$

## Section B — 2 Marks Each

### Q6.
Write balanced chemical equations for the following processes:

(i) XeF₂ undergoes hydrolysis.
(ii) MnO₂ is heated with conc. HCl.

**Answer:**

**(i)** Hydrolysis of XeF₂:

$$2XeF_2(s) + 2H_2O(l) \longrightarrow 2Xe(g) + 4HF(aq) + O_2(g)$$

**(ii)** MnO₂ heated with conc. HCl:

$$4HCl + MnO_2 \longrightarrow Cl_2 + MnCl_2 + 2H_2O$$

**OR**

Arrange the following in the order of the property indicated for each set:

**(i)** $H_2O,\ H_2S,\ H_2Se,\ H_2Te$ — **increasing acidic character**

**(ii)** $HF,\ HCl,\ HBr,\ HI$ — **decreasing bond enthalpy**

**Answer:**

**(i)** Increasing acidic character:
$$H_2O < H_2S < H_2Se < H_2Te$$
(Acidic strength increases down the group as bond strength decreases.)

**(ii)** Decreasing bond enthalpy:
$$HF > HCl > HBr > HI$$
(Bond enthalpy decreases as atomic size and bond length increase down the group.)

### Q7.
State Raoult's law for a solution containing volatile components. Write two characteristics of the solution which obeys Raoult's law at all concentrations.

**Answer:**

**Raoult's Law:**
For a solution of two volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component is directly proportional to its mole fraction present in solution.

$$P_1 \propto x_1$$

$$\boxed{P_1 = P_1^\circ \cdot x_1}$$

Where:
- $P_1$ = Partial pressure of component 1
- $x_1$ = Mole fraction of component 1
- $P_1^\circ$ = Vapour pressure of pure component 1

**Characteristics of an Ideal Solution (obeys Raoult's law at all concentrations):**

(i) $\Delta_{mix}H = 0$ (No heat is absorbed or released on mixing)

(ii) $\Delta_{mix}V = 0$ (No change in volume on mixing)

---

### Q8.
For the reaction:

$$2H_2O_2 \xrightarrow{I^-,\ \text{alkaline medium}} 2H_2O + O_2$$

The proposed mechanism is:

**(1)** $H_2O_2 + I^- \longrightarrow H_2O + IO^-$ (slow)

**(2)** $H_2O_2 + IO^- \longrightarrow H_2O + I^- + O_2$ (fast)

(i) Write the rate law for the reaction.
(ii) Write the overall order of reaction.
(iii) Out of steps (1) and (2), which one is the rate determining step?

**Answer:**

**(i) Rate Law:**

The rate of reaction is determined by the slowest step (Step 1):

$$\text{Rate} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d[H_2O_2]}{dt} = k[H_2O_2][I^-]$$

**(ii) Overall Order of Reaction:**

$$\text{Rate} = k[H_2O_2][I^-]$$

Order with respect to $H_2O_2$ = 1
Order with respect to $I^-$ = 1

$$\text{Overall order} = 1 + 1 = \boxed{2}$$

**(iii) Rate Determining Step:**

The **slowest step** is the rate determining step. Therefore, **Step (1)** is the rate determining step.

$$2MnO_2 + 4KOH + O_2 \longrightarrow 2K_2MnO_4 + 2H_2O$$
$$\hspace{8.5cm}\textbf{(A) Dark Green}$$

**Disproportionation of (A) to give (B):**

$$3MnO_4^{2-} + 4H^+ \longrightarrow 2MnO_4^- + MnO_2 + 2H_2O$$
$$\hspace{5.5cm}\textbf{(B) Purple}$$

**In acidified solution — (B) oxidises KI to (D):**

$$10I^- + 2MnO_4^- + 16H^+ \longrightarrow 2Mn^{2+} + 8H_2O + 5I_2$$
$$\hspace{5.5cm}\textbf{(D) } I_2$$

**In alkaline solution — (B) oxidises KI to (C):**

(i) paramagnetic
(ii) more stable
(iii) inner orbital complex
(iv) high spin complex

(Atomic no. of Co = 27)

**Answer:**

Electronic configuration:
$$Co\ (Z=27) = 1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\ 3s^2\ 3p^6\ 4s^2\ 3d^7$$
$$Co^{3+} = 1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\ 3s^2\ 3p^6\ 3d^6$$

**$[CoF_6]^{3-}$:**
- $F^-$ is a **weak field ligand** → does not cause pairing of electrons
- Hybridisation: $sp^3d^2$ (outer orbital)
- 3d orbitals retain unpaired electrons

[Diagram: For $[CoF_6]^{3-}$ — 3d orbitals show 4 unpaired electrons; $sp^3d^2$ hybrid orbitals (using 4s, 4p, 4d) filled by 6 pairs of electrons from 6 $F^-$ ions → outer orbital / high spin complex]

**$[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$:**
- $en$ is a **strong field ligand** → causes pairing of electrons in 3d
- Hybridisation: $d^2sp^3$ (inner orbital)
- All 3d electrons are paired

[Diagram: For $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ — 3d orbitals show all electrons paired (3 pairs); $d^2sp^3$ hybrid orbitals filled by 6 pairs of electrons from 3 en ligands → inner orbital / low spin complex]

**(i)** $[CoF_6]^{3-}$ is **paramagnetic** due to the presence of **four unpaired electrons**.

**(ii)** $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ is **more stable** due to the **chelate effect** (en is a bidentate ligand forming chelate rings).

**(iii)** $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ is the **inner orbital complex** ($d^2sp^3$ hybridisation using inner 3d orbitals).

**(iv)** $[CoF_6]^{3-}$ is the **high spin complex** ($sp^3d^2$ hybridisation, weak field ligand, maximum unpaired electrons).

**(i)**
$$\text{Ethylbenzene} \xrightarrow{KMnO_4-KOH} A \xrightarrow{H_3O^+} B$$

**(ii)**
$$\text{Cyclohexanol} \xrightarrow{CrO_3} A \xrightarrow{H_2N-NH-CONH_2} B$$

**Answer:**

**(i)**

$$\underset{\text{Ethylbenzene}}{C_6H_5CH_2CH_3} \xrightarrow{KMnO_4-KOH} \underset{\textbf{A}}{C_6H_5COOK} \xrightarrow{H_3O^+} \underset{\textbf{B (Benzoic acid)}}{C_6H_5COOH}$$

- **A** = Potassium benzoate ($C_6H_5COOK$)
- **B** = Benzoic acid ($C_6H_5COOH$)

**(ii)**

$$\underset{\text{Cyclohexanol}}{\text{Cyclohexanol}} \xrightarrow{CrO_3} \underset{\textbf{A}}{\text{Cyclohexanone}} \xrightarrow{H_2N-NH-CONH_2} \underset{\textbf{B}}{\text{Cyclohexanone semicarbazone}}$$

- **A** = Cyclohexanone (cyclic ketone with C=O)
- **B** = Cyclohexanone semicarbazone (cyclohexane ring with $=N-NH-CONH_2$ substituent)

[Diagram: (i) Side chain of ethylbenzene oxidised to –COOK (salt A), then acidified to –COOH (benzoic acid B). (ii) –OH of cyclohexanol oxidised to C=O (cyclohexanone A); then reaction with semicarbazide gives C=N–NH–CONH₂ (semicarbazone B)]

### Q13.
The decomposition of NH₃ on platinum surface is a zero order reaction. If the rate constant $(k)$ is $4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$, how long will it take to reduce the initial concentration of NH₃ from 0.1 M to 0.064 M?

**Answer:**

**Given:**
$$k = 4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1}$$
$$[A_0] = 0.1\ \text{M}$$
$$[A] = 0.064\ \text{M}$$

**For a zero-order reaction:**

$$k = \frac{1}{t}\{[A_0] - [A]\}$$

$$4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{Ms}^{-1} = \frac{1}{t}\{0.1 - 0.064\}$$

$$t = \frac{0.1 - 0.064}{4 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{0.036}{4 \times 10^{-3}}$$

$$\boxed{t = 9\ \text{seconds}}$$

### Q14.
(i) What is the role of activated charcoal in gas masks?
(ii) A colloidal sol is prepared by adding FeCl₃ solution into NaOH solution. What is the charge on hydrated ferric oxide colloidal particles formed? How is the solution represented?
(iii) How does chemisorption vary with temperature?

**Answer:**

**(i) Role of Activated Charcoal in Gas Masks:**
Activated charcoal is used in gas masks to **adsorb poisonous gases** (such as those found in coal mines or toxic environments) due to its very large surface area. This prevents harmful gases from entering the respiratory system.

**(ii) Charge on Hydrated Ferric Oxide Colloidal Particles:**

When FeCl₃ solution is added to NaOH solution, the Fe₂O₃·xH₂O particles adsorb $OH^-$ ions (from NaOH) on their surface.

- **Charge:** **Negative** (due to adsorption of $OH^-$ ions)
- **Representation:** $Fe_2O_3 \cdot xH_2O / OH^-$ (negatively charged sol)

**(iii) Variation of Chemisorption with Temperature:**

- As temperature **increases**, chemisorption **first increases** because molecules acquire the necessary activation energy for adsorption.
- After reaching a maximum, chemisorption **decreases** with further increase in temperature (as the process becomes reversible and desorption dominates).

[Diagram: Graph of extent of adsorption (x/m) vs Temperature — curve rises to a peak and then decreases, showing a maximum]

### Q15.
An element crystallizes in fcc lattice with a cell edge of 300 pm. The density of the element is $10.8\ \text{g cm}^{-3}$. Calculate the number of atoms in 108 g of the element.

**Answer:**

**Volume of unit cell:**

$$a = 300\ \text{pm} = 3.00 \times 10^{-8}\ \text{cm}$$

$$V_{cell} = a^3 = (3.00 \times 10^{-8})^3 = 2.7 \times 10^{-23}\ \text{cm}^3$$

**Volume of 108 g of element:**

$$V = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}} = \frac{108\ \text{g}}{10.8\ \text{g cm}^{-3}} = 10\ \text{cm}^3$$

**Number of unit cells in this volume:**

$$N_{cells} = \frac{10\ \text{cm}^3}{2.7 \times 10^{-23}\ \text{cm}^3/\text{unit cell}} = \frac{10^{24}}{2.7}\ \text{unit cells}$$

**Total number of atoms** (since each FCC unit cell contains **4 atoms**):

$$N_{atoms} = 4 \times \frac{10^{24}}{2.7}$$

$$\boxed{N_{atoms} = 1.48 \times 10^{24}\ \text{atoms}}$$

### Q16.
A 4% solution (w/w) of sucrose ($M = 342\ \text{g mol}^{-1}$) in water has a freezing point of 271.15 K. Calculate the freezing point of 5% glucose ($M = 180\ \text{g mol}^{-1}$) in water.
(Given: Freezing point of pure water = 273.15 K)

**Answer:**

**Molality formula:**
$$m = \frac{n}{W_{\text{solvent(kg)}}}$$

**For sucrose solution** (4 g sucrose in 96 g water):

$$m_{sucrose} = \frac{\dfrac{4}{342}}{\dfrac{96}{1000}} = \frac{4}{342} \times \frac{1000}{96} = 0.122\ \text{m}$$

$$\Delta T_f = 273.15 - 271.15 = 2\ \text{K}$$

$$\Delta T_f = K_f \times m \implies 2 = K_f \times 0.122 \quad \cdots(1)$$

**For glucose solution** (5 g glucose in 95 g water):

$$m_{glucose} = \frac{\dfrac{5}{180}}{\dfrac{95}{1000}} = \frac{5}{180} \times \frac{1000}{95} = 0.292\ \text{m}$$

$$(\Delta T_f)_2 = K_f \times 0.292 \quad \cdots(2)$$

**Dividing equation (2) by equation (1):**

$$\frac{(\Delta T_f)_2}{2} = \frac{K_f \times 0.292}{K_f \times 0.122}$$

$$(\Delta T_f)_2 = \frac{0.292}{0.122} \times 2 = 4.79\ \text{K}$$

**Freezing point of glucose solution:**

$$T_f = 273.15 - 4.79 = \boxed{268.36\ \text{K}}$$

### Q17.
(a) Name the method of refining which is:
(i) Used to obtain semiconductor of high purity.
(ii) Used to obtain low boiling metal.

(b) Write the chemical reactions taking place in the extraction of copper from Cu₂S.

**Answer:**

**(a)**

**(i)** **Zone Refining** — used to obtain semiconductors (e.g., Si, Ge) of very high purity.

**(ii)** **Distillation** — used to obtain low boiling metals (e.g., Zinc).

**(b) Extraction of Copper from Cu₂S:**

**Step 1 — Roasting** (sulphide ore converted to oxide):

$$2Cu_2S + 3O_2 \longrightarrow 2Cu_2O + 2SO_2$$

**Step 2 — Reduction** (oxide reduced to metal using coke):

$$Cu_2O + C \longrightarrow 2Cu + CO$$

### Q18.
Give reasons for the following:

(i) Transition elements and their compounds act as catalysts.
(ii) $E^\circ$ value for $(Mn^{2+}|Mn)$ is negative whereas for $(Cu^{2+}|Cu)$ is positive.
(iii) Actinoids show irregularities in their electronic configurations.

**Answer:**

**(i) Transition Elements as Catalysts:**
Transition elements and their compounds act as catalysts due to:
- Their ability to adopt **multiple oxidation states** (variable valency), which allows them to form intermediate compounds.
- Their ability to **form complexes** and provide a suitable surface for reactions (heterogeneous catalysis).

**(ii) $E^\circ$ for $(Mn^{2+}|Mn)$ is negative; for $(Cu^{2+}|Cu)$ is positive:**

- For **Mn**: The sum of sublimation enthalpy and first two ionisation enthalpies is effectively compensated by hydration enthalpy, resulting in a net negative $E^\circ$ (Mn is more easily oxidised).
- For **Cu**: The **hydration enthalpy** of $Cu^{2+}$ is **not sufficient** to compensate the sum of sublimation enthalpy and the first and second ionisation enthalpies. Hence, $E^\circ$ for $Cu^{2+}|Cu$ is **positive** (Cu is less easily oxidised; more noble).

**(iii) Irregularities in Electronic Configuration of Actinoids:**
Actinoids show irregularities in electronic configuration because these irregularities are related to the extra stability associated with:
- **Half-filled** ($f^7$)
- **Completely filled** ($f^{14}$)
- **Empty** ($f^0$)

occupancies of the 5f orbitals.

[Diagram: Polymer with repeating unit containing a triazine ring (6-membered ring with 3 N atoms) with –NH– groups and –NH–CH₂– linkages]

**(iii)** What is the role of sulphur in vulcanization of rubber?

**Answer:**

**(i)** It is a **homopolymer** because only **one type of monomer** (propene, $CH_2=CH-CH_3$) is used in its formation without loss of any small molecule.

$$CH_2 = CH \xrightarrow{\text{Polymerisation}} \left[-CH_2 - CH -\right]_n$$
$$\quad\quad\quad | \hspace{4.5cm} |$$
$$\quad\quad CH_3 \hspace{4cm} CH_3$$
$$\text{Propene} \hspace{3cm} \text{Polypropylene}$$

**(ii)** Monomers of the polymer (Melamine-formaldehyde resin):

- **Melamine** ($C_3H_6N_6$): Triazine ring with three $-NH_2$ groups
- **Formaldehyde** (HCHO)

[Diagram: Melamine structure — triazine ring (s-triazine: 3 C and 3 N alternating) with –NH₂ at each carbon; combined with HCHO to give polymer with –NH–CH₂– bridges]

**(iii) Role of Sulphur in Vulcanization of Rubber:**
In vulcanization, **sulphur forms cross-links** (disulphide bridges, –S–S–) at the reactive sites of the **double bonds** of natural rubber chains. This cross-linking makes the rubber:
- Harder and more rigid
- Less sticky
- More resistant to temperature changes and solvents

### Q20.
(i) What type of drug is used in sleeping pills?
(ii) What type of detergents are used in toothpastes?
(iii) Why is the use of alitame as an artificial sweetener not recommended?

**Answer:**

**(i)** **Tranquilizers** (a type of neurologically active drug / psychotherapeutic drug) are used in sleeping pills.
*Example:* Barbiturates, Valium (Diazepam).

**(ii)** **Anionic detergents** (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate) are used in toothpastes.

**(iii)** The use of alitame is not recommended because:
It is difficult to **control the sweetness of food** when using alitame, as it is an extremely potent sweetener (much sweeter than aspartame) and very small amounts can make food excessively sweet.

**OR**

Define the following terms with a suitable example in each:

**(i) Broad-spectrum antibiotics**
**(ii) Disinfectants**
**(iii) Cationic detergents**

**Answer:**

**(i) Broad-spectrum antibiotics:**
Antibiotics that kill or inhibit the growth of a **wide range** of both **gram-positive** and **gram-negative** bacteria are called broad-spectrum antibiotics.

*Example:* Chloramphenicol, Vancomycin, Ofloxacin.

**(ii) Disinfectants:**
Chemicals that either **kill** or **prevent the growth** of microorganisms. They are applied to **non-living objects** (unlike antiseptics which are used on living tissue).

*Example:* Chlorine ($Cl_2$) used to disinfect drinking water; $SO_2$ used as a disinfectant.

**(iii) Cationic detergents:**
These are **quaternary ammonium salts** of amines with acetates, chlorides, or bromides as anions. The cationic part (with a long hydrophobic chain and positively charged N) is responsible for cleansing action.

*Example:* Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide $[CH_3(CH_2)_{15}N(CH_3)_3]^+Br^-$

### Q21.
(i) Out of $(CH_3)_3C - Br$ and $(CH_3)_3C - I$, which one is more reactive towards $S_N1$ and why?
(ii) Write the product formed when p-nitrochlorobenzene is heated with aqueous NaOH at 443 K followed by acidification.
(iii) Why are dextro and laevo-rotatory isomers of Butan-2-ol difficult to separate by fractional distillation?

**Answer:**

**(i)** $(CH_3)_3C - I$ is **more reactive** towards $S_N1$.

**Reason:** In $S_N1$ reactions, the rate depends on the stability of the carbocation intermediate. Since both compounds give the same tertiary carbocation $(CH_3)_3C^+$ after removal of the leaving group, the reactivity depends on the **ease of departure** of the leaving group.

$$\underset{(CH_3)_3C-Br}{} \longrightarrow (CH_3)_3C^+ + Br^-$$
$$\underset{(CH_3)_3C-I}{} \longrightarrow (CH_3)_3C^+ + I^-$$

$I^-$ is a **better leaving group** than $Br^-$ (weaker C–I bond, larger and more polarisable $I^-$). Hence, $(CH_3)_3C-I$ is more reactive in $S_N1$.

**(ii)** p-Nitrochlorobenzene reacted with aqueous NaOH at 443 K, followed by acidification:

$$\underset{\text{p-nitrochlorobenzene}}{p\text{-}NO_2\text{-}C_6H_4\text{-}Cl} \xrightarrow{\text{aq. NaOH, 443 K}} p\text{-}NO_2\text{-}C_6H_4\text{-}ONa \xrightarrow{H^+} \underset{\textbf{4-Nitrophenol}}{p\text{-}NO_2\text{-}C_6H_4\text{-}OH}$$

**(iii)** The dextro ($+$) and laevo ($-$) rotatory isomers of Butan-2-ol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images of each other). Enantiomers have **identical physical properties** including the **same boiling point**. Since fractional distillation separates compounds based on differences in boiling points, enantiomers **cannot be separated** by this method.

**OR**

Write chemical reactions to show that the open structure of D-glucose contains the following:

(i) Straight chain
(ii) Five alcohol groups
(iii) Aldehyde as carbonyl group

**Answer:**

**(i) Straight Chain:**

On prolonged heating with HI, glucose forms **n-hexane**, indicating that all six carbon atoms are linked in a continuous straight chain.

$$\underset{\text{D-Glucose}}{C_6H_{12}O_6} \xrightarrow{\text{HI, prolonged heating}} \underset{\text{n-hexane}}{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}$$

**(ii) Five Alcohol Groups:**

### Q25.
$E^\circ_{cell}$ for the given redox reaction is 2.71 V:

$$Mg_{(s)} + Cu^{2+}_{(0.01\ M)} \longrightarrow Mg^{2+}_{(0.001\ M)} + Cu_{(s)}$$

Calculate $E_{cell}$ for the reaction. Write the direction of flow of current when an external opposite potential applied is:
(i) less than 2.71 V
(ii) greater than 2.71 V

**Answer:**

**Reaction Quotient Q:**

$$Q = \frac{[Mg^{2+}][Cu]}{[Mg][Cu^{2+}]} = \frac{(0.001)(1)}{(1)(0.01)} = 0.1$$

(Concentrations of pure solids Mg and Cu are taken as 1)

**Using Nernst Equation** (n = 2 for the transfer of 2 electrons):

$$E_{cell} = E^\circ_{cell} - \frac{0.0591}{n}\log Q$$

$$E_{cell} = 2.71 - \frac{0.0591}{2}\log(0.1)$$

$$E_{cell} = 2.71 - \frac{0.0591}{2} \times (-1)$$

$$E_{cell} = 2.71 + 0.02955$$

$$\boxed{E_{cell} \approx 2.74\ \text{V}}$$

**Direction of Current Flow:**

**(i) External potential < 2.71 V (< $E_{cell}$):**
The cell acts as a **galvanic cell**. Current flows from the **cathode to the anode** through the external circuit (i.e., conventional current flows from Cu electrode (cathode) to Mg electrode (anode) externally).

**(ii) External potential > 2.71 V (> $E_{cell}$):**
The cell acts as an **electrolytic cell** (electrolysis occurs). Current flows from the **anode to the cathode** through the external circuit (i.e., the direction is reversed).

**OR**

**(a)** A steady current of 2 amperes was passed through two electrolytic cells X and Y connected in series containing electrolytes FeSO₄ and ZnSO₄ until 2.8 g of Fe deposited at the cathode of cell X. How long did the current flow? Calculate the mass of Zn deposited at the cathode of cell Y.

$(Molar\ mass: Fe = 56\ g\ mol^{-1},\ Zn = 65.3\ g\ mol^{-1},\ 1\ F = 96500\ C\ mol^{-1})$

**(b)** In the plot of molar conductivity $(\Lambda_m)$ vs square root of concentration $(c^{1/2})$, curves are obtained for two electrolytes A and B. Identify A and B as strong or weak electrolyte and explain.

[Diagram: Graph with $\Lambda_m$ on y-axis and $c^{1/2}$ on x-axis; Curve A shows a gentle decrease (nearly linear, extrapolates to finite intercept); Curve B shows a steep, non-linear increase as concentration decreases to zero — cannot be extrapolated]

**Answer:**

**(a)**

At cathode of Cell X:
$$Fe^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \longrightarrow Fe(s)$$

Charge required to deposit 56 g of Fe = $96500 \times 2 = 193000$ C

Charge required to deposit 2.8 g of Fe:
$$Q = \frac{193000 \times 2.8}{56} = 9650\ \text{C}$$

**Time for which current flowed:**

$$Q = I \times t \implies t = \frac{Q}{I} = \frac{9650}{2} = \boxed{4825\ \text{s}}$$

**Mass of Zn deposited at cathode of Cell Y:**

Using Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis:

$$\frac{W_1}{W_2} = \frac{E_1}{E_2} = \frac{\text{Equivalent weight of Fe}}{\text{Equivalent weight of Zn}}$$

$$\frac{2.8}{W_2} = \frac{56/2}{65.3/2} = \frac{56}{65.3}$$

$$W_2 = \frac{2.8 \times 65.3}{56} = \boxed{3.265\ \text{g}}$$

**(b) Identification of Electrolytes A and B:**

- **Electrolyte A** (gentle, nearly linear decrease of $\Lambda_m$ with $c^{1/2}$, can be extrapolated to zero concentration) = **Strong Electrolyte**
  - For strong electrolytes, $\Lambda_m$ can be obtained by extrapolation to $c \to 0$ to get $\Lambda^\circ_m$ (molar conductance at infinite dilution).

- **Electrolyte B** (steep, non-linear increase of $\Lambda_m$ as concentration decreases, cannot be extrapolated) = **Weak Electrolyte**
  - For weak electrolytes, $\Lambda_m$ increases steeply on dilution (due to increased dissociation). Therefore, $\Lambda^\circ_m$ **cannot** be obtained by extrapolation for weak electrolytes.

### Q26.
**(a)** How do you convert the following:
(i) Phenol to Anisole
(ii) Ethanol to Propan-2-ol

**(b)** Write the mechanism of the following reaction:
$$C_2H_5OH \xrightarrow{H_2SO_4,\ 443\ K} CH_2 = CH_2 + H_2O$$

**(c)** Why does phenol undergo electrophilic substitution more easily than benzene?

**Answer:**

**(a)(i) Phenol to Anisole — Williamson Synthesis:**

$$\underset{\text{Phenol}}{C_6H_5OH} \xrightarrow{NaOH} \underset{\text{Sodium phenoxide}}{C_6H_5O^-Na^+} \xrightarrow{CH_3Br} \underset{\textbf{Anisole}}{C_6H_5OCH_3}$$

[Diagram: Phenol reacts with NaOH to form sodium phenoxide (C₆H₅O⁻Na⁺); sodium phenoxide reacts with CH₃Br via Williamson synthesis to give Anisole (C₆H₅OCH₃)]

**(a)(ii) Ethanol to Propan-2-ol:**

**Step 1:** Oxidise ethanol to acetaldehyde using PCC:

$$CH_3CH_2OH \xrightarrow{PCC} CH_3CHO$$

**Step 2:** React acetaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide (Grignard reagent), then hydrolyse:

$$CH_3CHO + CH_3MgBr \longrightarrow CH_3CH(CH_3) - OMgBr \xrightarrow{H_2O} \underset{\textbf{Propan-2-ol}}{CH_3CH(OH)CH_3}$$

**(b) Mechanism: Dehydration of Ethanol to Ethene**

**Step 1 — Formation of protonated alcohol (Fast):**

$$H-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-O-H + H^+ \underset{}{\overset{\text{Fast}}{\rightleftharpoons}} H-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\overset{+}{O}H_2$$

Ethanol is protonated by $H_2SO_4$ to form a good leaving group ($H_2O$).

**Step 2 — Formation of Carbocation (Slow, Rate-determining):**

$$H-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\overset{+}{O}H_2 \underset{}{\overset{\text{Slow}}{\rightleftharpoons}} H-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\overset{+}{C}H_2 + H_2O$$

The protonated ethanol loses water to form an ethyl carbocation.

**Step 3 — Formation of Ethene (Fast):**

$$H-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{C}}-\overset{+}{C}H_2 \longrightarrow H_2C = CH_2 + H^+$$

A proton is lost from the adjacent carbon, forming ethene and regenerating the acid catalyst.

**(c) Phenol undergoes electrophilic substitution more easily than benzene:**

The $-OH$ group attached to the benzene ring in phenol is an **activating group**. Due to resonance, the lone pair on oxygen delocalises into the ring, increasing the **electron density at the ortho and para positions**. This makes the ring more nucleophilic and thus more susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Hence, phenol undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution **more easily and faster** than benzene.

**OR**

**(a)(i)** Account for: o-nitrophenol is more steam volatile than p-nitrophenol.

**(a)(ii)** Account for: t-butyl chloride on heating with sodium methoxide gives 2-methylpropene instead of t-butyl methyl ether.

**(b)** Write the reaction involved in the following:
(i) Reimer-Tiemann reaction
(ii) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation of Phenol

**(c)** Give a simple chemical test to distinguish between Ethanol and Phenol.

**Answer:**

**(a)(i) o-Nitrophenol vs p-Nitrophenol — Steam Volatility:**

- **o-Nitrophenol** forms **intramolecular hydrogen bonding** (between –OH and –NO₂ within the same molecule). This prevents association between molecules, making it **volatile** (lower boiling point).

- **p-Nitrophenol** forms **intermolecular hydrogen bonding** (between –OH of one molecule and –NO₂ of another). This causes association between molecules, making it **less volatile** (higher boiling point).

[Diagram: o-Nitrophenol with intramolecular H-bond shown as dotted line between O–H and O of –NO₂ within the same molecule; p-Nitrophenol showing intermolecular H-bonds between –OH of one molecule and –NO₂ of another molecule]

Therefore, **o-nitrophenol is more steam volatile** than p-nitrophenol.

**(a)(ii) t-Butyl chloride with sodium methoxide gives 2-methylpropene:**

$$\underset{\text{t-Butyl chloride}}{(CH_3)_3C-Cl} + CH_3ONa^- \longrightarrow \underset{\textbf{2-Methylpropene}}{CH_2 = C(CH_3)_2} + CH_3OH + NaCl$$

**Reason:** Sodium methoxide ($CH_3O^-Na^+$) is a **strong base** (and bulky nucleophile). With a tertiary halide like t-butyl chloride, the **elimination reaction (E2) predominates** over substitution ($S_N2$) because:
- The tertiary carbon is sterically hindered → $S_N2$ is disfavoured.
- The strong base abstracts a $\beta$-hydrogen, leading to elimination to form the alkene.

**(b)(i) Reimer-Tiemann Reaction:**

$$\underset{\text{Phenol}}{C_6H_5OH} \xrightarrow{CHCl_3 + \text{aq. NaOH}} [\text{Intermediate with CHCl}_2] \xrightarrow{NaOH} \underset{\text{Sodium salicylate}}{\text{o-HOC}_6H_4COONa} \xrightarrow{H^+} \underset{\textbf{Salicylaldehyde}}{\text{o-HOC}_6H_4CHO}$$

[Diagram: Phenol + CHCl₃/NaOH → ortho-hydroxybenzaldehyde sodium salt (intermediate with –CHCl₂ on ring) → after NaOH treatment → Salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) on acidification]

Phenol reacts with chloroform in the presence of aqueous NaOH to give ortho-hydroxy benzaldehyde (**salicylaldehyde**) as the major product.

**(b)(ii) Friedel-Crafts Alkylation of Phenol:**

$$\underset{\text{Phenol}}{C_6H_5OH} \xrightarrow{CH_3Cl,\ \text{Anh. AlCl}_3} \underset{\text{o-Cresol}}{o\text{-}CH_3C_6H_4OH} + \underset{\text{p-Cresol}}{p\text{-}CH_3C_6H_4OH}$$

[Diagram: Phenol reacts with CH₃Cl in presence of anhydrous AlCl₃ to give a mixture of o-cresol (2-methylphenol) and p-cresol (4-methylphenol)]

**(c) Chemical Test to Distinguish Ethanol and Phenol — Iodoform Test:**

**Ethanol** gives a **positive iodoform test**:

$$C_2H_5OH \xrightarrow{I_2/NaOH} [CH_3CHO] \longrightarrow CHI_3 \downarrow + HCOONa$$

A **yellow precipitate** of iodoform ($CHI_3$) is formed.

**Phenol** does **not** give iodoform test:

$$C_6H_5OH \xrightarrow{I_2/NaOH} \text{No yellow precipitate}$$

**Observation:** Ethanol gives a yellow precipitate (iodoform); phenol does not.

### Q27.
**(a)** Give reasons for the following:
(i) Sulphur in vapour state shows paramagnetic behaviour.
(ii) N–N bond is weaker than P–P bond.
(iii) Ozone is thermodynamically less stable than oxygen.

**(b)** Write the name of gas released when Cu is added to:
(i) dilute HNO₃
(ii) conc. HNO₃

**Answer:**

**(a)(i) Sulphur in Vapour State is Paramagnetic:**

Sulphur in vapour state exists as **$S_2$ molecules**, which are analogous to $O_2$. Like oxygen, $S_2$ has **two unpaired electrons** in the $\pi^*$ (pi-antibonding) molecular orbitals (following Hund's rule). The presence of unpaired electrons makes $S_2$ **paramagnetic**.

**(a)(ii) N–N bond is weaker than P–P bond:**

Due to the **very small atomic size of nitrogen**, the non-bonding lone pairs on adjacent nitrogen atoms experience **strong interelectronic repulsion** (lone pair – lone pair repulsion). This repulsion weakens the N–N single bond.

In contrast, **phosphorus** has a larger atomic size, so the lone pairs are farther apart and repulsion is much less. Therefore, **P–P single bond is stronger than N–N single bond**.

**(a)(iii) Ozone is thermodynamically less stable than oxygen:**

The decomposition of ozone into oxygen is:

$$2O_3(g) \longrightarrow 3O_2(g)$$

This reaction results in:
- **Liberation of heat** ($\Delta H < 0$, exothermic)
- **Increase in entropy** ($\Delta S > 0$, more moles of gas)

Together, these give a **large negative Gibbs energy change** ($\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S < 0$), meaning the decomposition is spontaneous. Hence, ozone is **thermodynamically less stable** than oxygen.

**(b) Gas Released when Cu is added to HNO₃:**

**(i) Cu + dilute HNO₃ → Nitrogen monoxide (NO):**

$$3Cu + 8HNO_3\ (\text{dil.}) \longrightarrow 3Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2NO\upar
