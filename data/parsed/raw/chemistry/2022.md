### Q2.
In the given reaction:
$$N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightarrow 2NH_3(g)$$
the rate of formation of $NH_3$ is $3.6 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$.

Calculate the `2×1=2`

**(i) Rate of reaction**

**(ii) Rate of disappearance of $H_2(g)$**

**Answer:**

**(i) Rate of reaction:**

The rate of formation of $NH_3$ is given as $3.6 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$.

For the reaction: $N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) \rightarrow 2NH_3(g)$

$$\text{Rate of reaction} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \text{Rate of formation of } NH_3$$

$$= \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times 3.6 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$$

$$= 1.8 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$$

---

**(ii) Rate of disappearance of $H_2$:**

According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of $H_2$ are consumed for every 2 moles of $NH_3$ formed.

$$\text{Rate of disappearance of } H_2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \times \text{Rate of formation of } NH_3$$

$$= \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \times 3.6 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$$

$$= 5.4 \times 10^{-4}\ mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$$

---

### Q3.
**(i)** State Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions.

**(ii)** Calculate the degree of dissociation $(\alpha)$ of $CH_3COOH$ if $\Lambda_m$ and $\Lambda_m^\circ$ of $CH_3COOH$ are $48\ S\ cm^2\ mol^{-1}$ and $400\ S\ cm^2\ mol^{-1}$ respectively. `2×1=2`

**Answer:**

**(i) Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions:**

Kohlrausch's law states that at infinite dilution, each ion contributes independently to the total molar conductivity of the electrolyte. The law can be mathematically expressed as:

$$\Lambda_m^\infty = \lambda^+ + \lambda^-$$

where $\Lambda_m^\infty$ is the molar conductivity at infinite dilution, and $\lambda^+$ and $\lambda^-$ are the ionic conductivities of the cation and anion respectively at infinite dilution.

---

**(ii) Degree of dissociation $(\alpha)$:**

The degree of dissociation $(\alpha)$ can be calculated using the relation:

$$\alpha = \frac{\Lambda_m}{\Lambda_m^\infty}$$

Given: $\Lambda_m = 48\ S\ cm^2\ mol^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_m^\infty = 400\ S\ cm^2\ mol^{-1}$

$$\alpha = \frac{48}{400} = 0.12$$

**Answer:** Tetraammineaquachloridocobalt(III) chloride

---

**(ii)** What is the difference between an Ambidentate ligand and a Bidentate ligand?

**Answer:**

- **Ambidentate ligand:** A ligand that can attach to the central metal atom through two different atoms but only one at a time.
  - **Example:** $SCN^-$ (thiocyanate can bind through sulphur or nitrogen)

- **Bidentate ligand:** A ligand that has two donor atoms and can form two bonds to a central metal atom simultaneously.
  - **Example:** $C_2O_4^{2-}$ (oxalate ion)

---

**(iii)** Out of $[Fe(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$ and $[Fe(C_2O_4)_3]^{3-}$, which complex is more stable and why? `3×1=3`

**Answer:**

$[Fe(C_2O_4)_3]^{3-}$ is more stable due to the **chelate effect**, where the multidentate ligand forms more stable ring-like structures with the central metal ion.

---

### Q5.
Calculate the emf of the following cell: `3 marks`

$$Zn(s)\ |\ Zn^{2+}(0.01\ M)\ ||\ (0.001\ M)\ Ag^+\ |\ Ag(s)$$

**Given:**
$$E^\circ_{Zn^{2+}/Zn} = -0.76\ V \quad \text{and} \quad E^\circ_{Ag^+/Ag} = +0.80\ V$$
$$[\log 2 = 0.3010,\ \log 3 = 0.4771,\ \log 10 = 1]$$

**Answer:**

The Nernst equation for the cell is:

$$E_{cell} = E^\circ_{cell} - \frac{0.0591}{n} \log \frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Ag^+]^2}$$

For the given cell, $n = 2$:

$$E^\circ_{cell} = E^\circ_{cathode} - E^\circ_{anode} = 0.80\ V - (-0.76\ V) = 1.56\ V$$

$$\frac{[Zn^{2+}]}{[Ag^+]^2} = \frac{0.01}{(0.001)^2} = 10000$$

$$\log 10000 = 4$$

$$E_{cell} = 1.56\ V - \frac{0.0591}{2} \times 4$$

$$E_{cell} = 1.56\ V - 0.1182$$

$$\boxed{E_{cell} = 1.4418\ V}$$

---

### Q6(a).
Write the major products in the following: `3×1=3`

**(i)**
[Diagram: Benzaldehyde (benzene ring with –CHO group) reacting with $HNO_3 + H_2SO_4$ at 273–283 K]

**(ii)**
[Diagram: Sodium benzoate (cyclohexane ring with –COONa group) reacting with NaOH and CaO under heat ($\Delta$)]

**(iii)**
$$CH_3 - C = O \xrightarrow{NH_2OH}\ ?$$
$$\quad\quad\quad |$$
$$\quad\quad\quad H$$

**Answer:**

**(i)**
$$\text{Benzaldehyde} \xrightarrow{HNO_3 + H_2SO_4,\ 273\text{–}283\ K} \text{Benzoic acid (–COOH)}$$

The –CHO group gets oxidised to –COOH under these conditions; additionally nitration can occur on the ring. The major product is **m-nitrobenzaldehyde** (nitration of benzaldehyde gives meta product due to –CHO being an EWG).

**(ii)**
$$\text{Sodium benzoate (C}_6H_5COONa) \xrightarrow{NaOH + CaO,\ \Delta} CH_4$$

**(iii)**
$$CH_3CHO + NH_2OH \rightarrow CH_3CH = NOH \quad \text{(Acetaldoxime)}$$

---

**(b)(i)** Oxidation of propanal is easier than propanone. Why?

**Answer:**

Propanal $(CH_3CH_2CHO)$ is an aldehyde, which has a hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon, making it more susceptible to oxidation. Propanone $(CH_3COCH_3)$ is a ketone and lacks this hydrogen atom, making it more resistant to oxidation.

---

**(b)(ii)** How can you distinguish between Acetophenone and Benzophenone?

**Answer:**

- **Acetophenone** $(C_6H_5COCH_3)$ gives a **positive iodoform test** due to the presence of a methyl ketone group, producing a yellow precipitate of iodoform (CHI₃).
- **Benzophenone** $(C_6H_5COC_6H_5)$ does **not** have a methyl ketone group and thus does **not** give a positive iodoform test.

---

**(b)(iii)** Draw the structure of the following derivative: `3×1=3`

**2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazone of Propanone**

**Answer:**

$$NO_2 - Ph - NH - N = C(CH_3)_2$$

[Diagram: 2,4-dinitrophenyl group attached to –NH–N= which is double bonded to C with two methyl groups; the phenyl ring has –NO₂ groups at the 2 and 4 positions]

### Q7.
A first order reaction takes 30 minutes for 75% decomposition. Calculate $t_{1/2}$.

**Given:** $\log 2 = 0.3,\ \log 3 = 0.48,\ \log 4 = 0.6,\ \log 5 = 0.7$ `3 marks`

**Answer:**

For a first order reaction:
$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$$

Given that 75% of the reaction is complete in 30 minutes, we can find $k$ using the formula:

$$t = \frac{2.303}{k} \log\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]_t}\right)$$

Since 75% decomposed, 25% remains:

$$t = 30\ \text{minutes}, \quad \frac{[A]_0}{[A]_t} = \frac{100}{25} = 4$$

$$\log 4 = 0.6$$

$$k = \frac{2.303 \times 0.6}{30} = 0.04606\ \text{min}^{-1}$$

Thus:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{0.04606} = \boxed{15\ \text{minutes}}$$

### Q8(a).
Write three differences between Lyophobic sol and Lyophilic sol. `3 marks`

**Answer:**

| Property | Lyophobic Sol | Lyophilic Sol |
|---|---|---|
| Stability | Less stable | More stable |
| Viscosity | Same as dispersion medium | Higher than dispersion medium |
| Reversibility | Irreversible | Reversible |

---

**OR**

### Q8(b).

**(i)** Write the dispersed phase and dispersion medium of **'milk'**.

**Answer:**
- **Dispersed phase:** Fat globules
- **Dispersion medium:** Water

---

**(ii)** What is the cause of Brownian movement in colloidal particles?

**Answer:**

Brownian movement is caused by the **constant and rapid bombardment** of colloidal particles by the molecules of the dispersion medium.

---

**(iii)** Why does physisorption decrease with increase in temperature? `3×1=3`

**Answer:**

Physisorption is an **exothermic process** and thus, according to **Le Chatelier's principle**, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction, thereby decreasing the extent of adsorption.

---

### Q9.
From the given $E^\circ$ values of the first row transition elements, answer the following questions: `3×1=3`

| $E^\circ_{M^{2+}/M}$ | Cr | Mn | Fe | Co | Ni | Cu | Zn |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | −0.91 | −1.18 | −0.44 | −0.28 | −0.25 | +0.34 | −0.76 |

**(i)** Why is $E^\circ_{M^{2+}/M}$ value highly negative for Mn as compared to other elements?

**Answer:**

The highly negative value of $E^\circ_{Mn^{2+}/Mn}$ is due to the **stable half-filled $d^5$ configuration** of $Mn^{2+}$, which makes the reduction process less favourable (i.e., $Mn^{2+}$ resists being reduced back to $Mn$).

---

**(ii)** What is the reason for the irregularity in the above $E^\circ$ values?

**Answer:**

The irregularity in the $E^\circ$ values is due to **varying stability of different oxidation states**, electronic configurations, ionisation enthalpies, hydration enthalpies, and lattice energies of the elements and their ions.

---

**(iii)** Why is $E^\circ_{Cu^{2+}/Cu}$ value exceptionally positive?

**Answer:**

The exceptionally positive value of $E^\circ_{Cu^{2+}/Cu}$ is due to the **high stability of the $Cu^{2+}$ ion in aqueous solution** (large hydration enthalpy) and the **relatively low atomisation enthalpy** of Cu, making the overall reduction process thermodynamically favourable.

---

### Q10(a).
Write the equation involved in the following reactions: `3×1=3`

**(i) Rosenmund reduction**

**Answer:**
$$RCOCl \xrightarrow{H_2,\ Pd/BaSO_4} RCHO$$

---

**(ii) Etard reaction**

**Answer:**
$$C_6H_5CH_3 \xrightarrow{CrO_2Cl_2,\ CS_2} C_6H_5CHO$$

---

**(iii) Stephen reaction**

**Answer:**
$$RCN \xrightarrow{SnCl_2,\ HCl} RCHO$$

---

**OR**

### Q10(b).
Which acid of each pair would you expect to be stronger? Give reason. `2+1=3`

**(i)** $CH_3COOH$ or $F-CH_2-COOH$

**Answer:**

$F-CH_2-COOH$ (fluoroacetic acid) is stronger due to the **electron-withdrawing inductive effect of fluorine**, which stabilises the conjugate base (carboxylate ion) and increases the acidity.

---

**(ii)**
[Diagram: Phenol (benzene ring with –OH group)] **or** $CH_3-COOH$

**Answer:**

**Phenol** is stronger than acetic acid — wait, actually $CH_3COOH$ is stronger than phenol in this context. The document states the one with the nitro group (electron-withdrawing) is stronger.

> **Corrected Answer:** $CH_3COOH$ is stronger than phenol because the carboxylic acid group releases a proton more readily than phenol. The conjugate base of acetic acid (acetate ion) is more stabilised by resonance than the phenoxide ion in terms of acid dissociation in water. *(If the question involves a nitro-substituted phenol vs. $CH_3COOH$, then the nitro-phenol is stronger due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the –NO₂ group which stabilises the conjugate base and increases acidity.)*

---

**(iii)** Distinguish between Pentan-2-one and Pentan-3-one.

**Answer:**

- **Pentan-2-one** $(CH_3COCH_2CH_2CH_3)$ gives a **positive iodoform test** due to the presence of a methyl ketone ($CH_3CO-$) group, producing a yellow precipitate of iodoform (CHI₃).
- **Pentan-3-one** $(CH_3CH_2COCH_2CH_3)$ does **not** have a methyl ketone group and thus does **not** give a positive iodoform test.

---

### Q11.
Account for the following: `3×1=3`

**(i)** Transition metals and their compounds show catalytic activities.

**Answer:**

Transition metals and their compounds show catalytic activities due to:
1. Their ability to **change oxidation states** easily, allowing them to form intermediates with reactants.
2. Their ability to **provide a surface** for the reaction to occur (heterogeneous catalysis).

---

**(ii)** Zn, Cd and Hg are non-transition elements.

**Answer:**

Zn, Cd, and Hg are **non-transition elements** because they do **not have partially filled d-orbitals** either in their elemental (ground) state or in their common oxidation states. Their completely filled $d^{10}$ configuration persists in all common oxidation states.

---

**(iii)** Zr and Hf are of almost identical atomic radii.

**Answer:**

Zr and Hf have almost identical atomic radii due to **lanthanide contraction**. The filling of 4f orbitals (across the lanthanide series) leads to a significant decrease in atomic size due to poor shielding by f-electrons. This decrease in size nearly exactly counteracts the expected increase in size going from Zr (4d series) to Hf (5d series), resulting in almost identical atomic radii.

## Section C — 5 marks

### Q12.
**Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow:** `1+1+1+2=5`

*Amines constitute an important class of organic compounds derived by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of ammonia molecule by alkyl/aryl groups. Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influences their physical properties. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups, respectively increase and decrease their basic character. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair of electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom on the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Reactivity of aromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process.*

---

**(i)** Why does aniline not give Friedel-Crafts reaction? `1 mark`

**Answer:**

Aniline does not give the Friedel-Crafts reaction because the **lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom coordinates with the Lewis acid catalyst** (like $AlCl_3$), forming an acid-base complex. This makes the nitrogen unavailable and also deactivates the ring, making the reaction unfavourable.

---

**(ii)** Arrange the following in the increasing order of their $pK_b$ values: `1 mark`

$$C_6H_5NH_2,\ NH_3,\ C_2H_5NH_2,\ (CH_3)_3N$$

**Answer:**

Increasing order of $pK_b$ (i.e., decreasing basicity):

$$C_6H_5NH_2 > NH_3 > (CH_3)_3N > C_2H_5NH_2$$

*(Higher $pK_b$ = weaker base; $C_6H_5NH_2$ is the weakest base with the highest $pK_b$, and $C_2H_5NH_2$ is the strongest base with the lowest $pK_b$ in aqueous solution.)*

---

**(iii)** How can you distinguish between $CH_3CH_2NH_2$ and $(CH_3CH_2)_2NH$ by Hinsberg test? `1 mark`

**Answer:**

- $CH_3CH_2NH_2$ (**primary amine**) reacts with Hinsberg reagent (benzenesulfonyl chloride, $C_6H_5SO_2Cl$) to form a **sulfonamide that is soluble in alkali** (NaOH), because the sulfonamide still has an acidic N–H proton.

- $(CH_3CH_2)_2NH$ (**secondary amine**) reacts with Hinsberg reagent to form an **insoluble sulfonamide** (no acidic N–H proton remains, so it does not dissolve in alkali).

---

**(iv)** Write the structures of A and B in the following reactions: `2×1=2`

**(I)**
[Diagram: Nitrobenzene (benzene ring with –NO₂ group) reacting with Sn + HCl to give A, then A reacting with Br₂ water to give B]

**Answer:**

- **A:** $C_6H_5NH_2$ (Aniline)
- **B:** $C_6H_4(NH_2)Br$ (ortho- or para-bromoaniline)

---

**(II)**
$$CH_3CH_2CONH_2 \xrightarrow{Br_2/alc.\ KOH} A \xrightarrow{CH_3COCl,\ Pyridine} B$$

**Answer:**

- **A:** $CH_3CH_2NH_2$ (Ethylamine — via Hoffmann bromamide degradation)
- **B:** $CH_3CH_2NHCOCH_3$ (N-ethylacetamide — via acylation of ethylamine)

---

**OR**

### Q12(b).
How will you convert the following: `2×1=2`

**(i) Benzoic acid to aniline**

**Answer:**

**Step 1:** Convert benzoic acid to benzamide:
$$C_6H_5COOH \xrightarrow{NH_3} C_6H_5CONH_2$$

**Step 2:** Apply Hoffmann bromamide degradation (or reduce benzamide to aniline):
$$C_6H_5CONH_2 \xrightarrow{Br_2/KOH} C_6H_5NH_2 \quad \text{(Aniline)}$$

*(Alternatively: $C_6H_5CONH_2 \xrightarrow{LiAlH_4} C_6H_5NH_2$)*

---

**(ii) Aniline to p-bromoaniline**

**Answer:**

**Step 1:** Acetylate aniline to protect the –NH₂ group:
$$C_6H_5NH_2 \xrightarrow{CH_3COCl,\ Pyridine} C_6H_5NHCOCH_3$$

**Step 2:** Brominate the acetyl derivative (–NHCOCH₃ is ortho/para director; bulky group favours para):
$$C_6H_5NHCOCH_3 \xrightarrow{Br_2} C_6H_4(Br)NHCOCH_3 \quad \text{(para)}$$

**Step 3:** Hydrolyse to get p-bromoaniline:
$$C_6H_4(Br)NHCOCH_3 \xrightarrow{H_2O,\ H^+} C_6H_4(Br)NH_2 \quad \text{(p-bromoaniline)}$$
