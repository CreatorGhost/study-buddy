### Q1.
The colligative property used for the determination of molar mass of polymers and proteins is:

(a) Osmotic pressure
(b) Depression in freezing point
(c) Relative lowering in vapour pressure
(d) Elevation in boiling point

**Answer:** (a) Osmotic pressure

**Solution:** Osmotic pressure is the preferred colligative property for determining the molar mass of polymers and proteins because even at very low concentrations, osmotic pressure gives a measurable and significant value. The magnitude of osmotic pressure is much larger compared to other colligative properties at the same concentration, making it more accurate and practical for large molecules like polymers and proteins.

### Q2.
Low concentration of oxygen in the blood and tissues of people living at high altitude is due to:

(a) High atmospheric pressure
(b) Low temperature
(c) Low atmospheric pressure
(d) Both low temperature and high atmospheric pressure

**Answer:** (c) Low atmospheric pressure

**Solution:** At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is low. According to Henry's law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. Since the partial pressure of oxygen decreases at high altitudes due to low atmospheric pressure, less oxygen dissolves in the blood, resulting in low oxygen concentration in blood and tissues.

### Q3.
The correct cell to represent the following reaction is:

$$\text{Zn} + 2\text{Ag}^+ \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\text{Ag}$$

(a) $2\text{Ag} \mid \text{Ag}^+ \parallel \text{Zn} \mid \text{Zn}^{2+}$
(b) $\text{Ag}^+ \mid \text{Ag} \parallel \text{Zn}^{2+} \mid \text{Zn}$
(c) $\text{Ag} \mid \text{Ag}^+ \parallel \text{Zn}^{2+} \mid \text{Zn}$
(d) $\text{Zn} \mid \text{Zn}^{2+} \parallel \text{Ag}^+ \mid \text{Ag}$

**Answer:** (d) $\text{Zn} \mid \text{Zn}^{2+} \parallel \text{Ag}^+ \mid \text{Ag}$

**Solution:** In a galvanic cell, the anode (oxidation) is written on the left and the cathode (reduction) is written on the right. Here, Zn is oxidised at the anode: $\text{Zn} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2e^-$, and Ag⁺ is reduced at the cathode: $\text{Ag}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag}$. The single vertical line $\mid$ represents a phase boundary and the double vertical line $\parallel$ represents the salt bridge. Therefore, the correct cell notation is $\text{Zn} \mid \text{Zn}^{2+} \parallel \text{Ag}^+ \mid \text{Ag}$.

### Q4.
$\Delta G$ and $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ for a spontaneous reaction will be:

(a) Positive, negative
(b) Negative, negative
(c) Negative, positive
(d) Positive, positive

**Answer:** (c) Negative, positive

**Solution:** For a spontaneous reaction, the Gibbs free energy change $\Delta G$ must be negative. The relationship between $\Delta G$ and $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ is given by:
$$\Delta G = -nFE^\circ_{\text{cell}}$$
For $\Delta G$ to be negative, $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ must be positive. Therefore, for a spontaneous reaction, $\Delta G < 0$ and $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} > 0$.

---

### Q5.
Which of the following is affected by a catalyst?

(a) $\Delta H$
(b) $\Delta G$
(c) $E_a$
(d) $\Delta S$

**Answer:** (c) $E_a$

**Solution:** A catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy ($E_a$). It does not alter the thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy change ($\Delta H$), Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$), or entropy change ($\Delta S$) of the reaction, since these are state functions that depend only on the initial and final states. Only the kinetic parameter $E_a$ is affected by the catalyst.

---

### Q6.
The order of the reaction $\text{H}_2(\text{g}) + \text{Cl}_2(\text{g}) \rightarrow 2\text{HCl}(\text{g})$ is:

(a) 2
(b) 1
(c) 0
(d) 4

**Answer:** (a) 2

**Solution:** The reaction between H₂ and Cl₂ to form HCl is an elementary bimolecular reaction. For an elementary reaction, the order equals the molecularity. Since one molecule of H₂ reacts with one molecule of Cl₂, the reaction is second order overall (first order with respect to H₂ and first order with respect to Cl₂), giving a total order of $1 + 1 = 2$.

---

### Q7.
The most common and stable oxidation state of a Lanthanoid is:

(a) +2
(b) +3
(c) +4
(d) +6

**Answer:** (b) +3

**Solution:** Lanthanoids most commonly exhibit the +3 oxidation state. This is because the loss of three electrons (two from the 6s orbital and one from the 4f orbital) gives a stable electronic configuration. The +3 oxidation state is the most stable and consistent oxidation state across the entire lanthanoid series.

---

### Q8.
The compounds $[\text{Co}(\text{SO}_4)(\text{NH}_3)_5]\text{Br}$ and $[\text{Co}(\text{Br})(\text{NH}_3)_5]\text{SO}_4$ represent:

(a) Optical isomerism
(b) Linkage isomerism
(c) Ionisation isomerism
(d) Coordination isomerism

**Answer:** (c) Ionisation isomerism

**Solution:** Ionisation isomers are coordination compounds that have the same molecular formula but produce different ions when dissolved in solution. In $[\text{Co}(\text{SO}_4)(\text{NH}_3)_5]\text{Br}$, $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ is inside the coordination sphere and $\text{Br}^-$ is the counter ion, while in $[\text{Co}(\text{Br})(\text{NH}_3)_5]\text{SO}_4$, $\text{Br}^-$ is inside the coordination sphere and $\text{SO}_4^{2-}$ is the counter ion. These compounds ionise to give different ions in solution, hence they are ionisation isomers.

---

### Q9.
The synthesis of alkyl fluoride is best obtained from:

(a) Free radicals
(b) Swartz reaction
(c) Sandmeyer reaction
(d) Finkelstein reaction

**Answer:** (b) Swartz reaction

**Solution:** The Swartz reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide (chloride or bromide) with a metal fluoride such as $\text{AgF}$, $\text{SbF}_3$, or $\text{Hg}_2\text{F}_2$ to give an alkyl fluoride. For example:
$$\text{R}-\text{Cl} + \text{AgF} \rightarrow \text{R}-\text{F} + \text{AgCl}$$
This is the best method for synthesizing alkyl fluorides since direct fluorination is too vigorous.

---

### Q10.
In the reaction $R-\text{OH} + \text{HCl} \xrightarrow{\text{ZnCl}_2} R\text{Cl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$, what is the correct order of reactivity of alcohol?

(a) $1° > 2° < 3°$
(b) $1° > 3° > 2°$
(c) $1° < 2° < 3°$
(d) $3° > 2° > 1°$

**Answer:** (d) $3° > 2° > 1°$

**Solution:** This reaction proceeds via an $S_N1$ mechanism (in the presence of $\text{ZnCl}_2$ as a Lewis acid catalyst). The reactivity depends on the stability of the carbocation intermediate formed. Tertiary carbocations are most stable (due to hyperconjugation and inductive effect of three alkyl groups), followed by secondary, and then primary. Therefore, the order of reactivity is $3° > 2° > 1°$.

---

### Q11.
$\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2$ on reaction with NaOH and Br₂ in alcoholic medium gives:

(a) $\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$
(b) $\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$
(c) $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Br}$
(d) $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{NH}_2$

**Answer:** (b) $\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$

**Solution:** This reaction is the Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction. When an amide ($\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2$) is treated with $\text{Br}_2$ and NaOH (alcoholic), the amide is converted to a primary amine with one fewer carbon atom:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{CONH}_2 + \text{Br}_2 + 4\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2 + \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + 2\text{NaBr} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$
This reaction involves migration of an alkyl group from the carbonyl carbon to the nitrogen atom, producing methylamine ($\text{CH}_3\text{NH}_2$).

---

### Q12.
Which of the following is least basic?

(a) $(\text{CH}_3)_2\text{NH}$
(b) $\text{NH}_3$
(c) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$ (Aniline)
(d) $(\text{CH}_3)_3\text{N}$

**Answer:** (c) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$ (Aniline)

**Solution:** Aniline ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2$) is the least basic among the given compounds. This is because the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the benzene ring through resonance, making it less available for protonation. The electron-withdrawing effect of the phenyl ring through resonance significantly reduces the electron density on the nitrogen, thereby reducing its basicity compared to aliphatic amines and ammonia.

---

### Q13.
The glycosidic linkage involved in linking the glucose units in amylose part of starch is:

(a) $\text{C}_1 - \text{C}_6\ \alpha$ linkage
(b) $\text{C}_1 - \text{C}_4\ \alpha$ linkage
(c) $\text{C}_1 - \text{C}_5\ \alpha$ linkage
(d) $\text{C}_1 - \text{C}_1\ \alpha$ linkage

**Answer:** (b) $\text{C}_1 - \text{C}_4\ \alpha$ linkage

**Solution:** Amylose is the linear, unbranched component of starch. The glucose units in amylose are linked by $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic bonds, meaning the C₁ of one glucose unit is linked to the C₄ of the next glucose unit through an $\alpha$-glycosidic linkage. This forms a helical structure. (Note: Amylopectin has additional $\alpha$-1,6-glycosidic linkages at branching points, but the main chain linkage in both amylose and amylopectin is $\alpha$-1,4.)

---

### Q14.
An $\alpha$-helix is a structural feature of:

(a) Proteins
(b) Starch
(c) Polypeptides
(d) Nucleotides

**Answer:** (a) Proteins

**Solution:** An $\alpha$-helix is a type of secondary structure found in proteins. It is a right-handed helical conformation in which the polypeptide backbone is coiled, stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the $\text{N-H}$ group of one amino acid residue and the $\text{C=O}$ group of another amino acid residue four positions down the chain. This is a characteristic structural feature of proteins, not of starch, isolated polypeptides (in the generic sense), or nucleotides.

*For Questions 15 to 18, two statements are given — one labelled as Assertion (A) and the other labelled as Reason (R). Select the correct answer from the codes given below:*

*(a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).*
*(b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).*
*(c) Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.*
*(d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.*

---

### Q15.
**Assertion (A):** $-\text{NH}_2$ group is ortho- and para-directing in electrophilic substitution reactions.

**Reason (R):** Aniline cannot undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction.

**Answer:** (b) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** The assertion is true: $-\text{NH}_2$ is an electron-donating group that activates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions through resonance donation of the lone pair on nitrogen into the ring.

The reason is also true: Aniline cannot undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction because the $-\text{NH}_2$ group acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst ($\text{AlCl}_3$), forming a salt ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NH}_2 \cdot \text{AlCl}_3$), which deactivates the ring and prevents the reaction.

However, the reason does not explain why $-\text{NH}_2$ is ortho/para directing; the two facts are independent of each other. Hence, option (b) is correct.

---

### Q16.
**Assertion (A):** Acetylation of aniline gives a monosubstituted product.

**Reason (R):** Activating effect of $-\text{NHCOCH}_3$ group is more than that of the amino group.

**Answer:** (c) Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.

**Solution:** The assertion is true. When aniline is acetylated (treated with acetic anhydride), the product is acetanilide ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{NHCOCH}_3$), a monosubstituted product. Acetylation protects the $-\text{NH}_2$ group and reduces its activating effect, leading to controlled monosubstitution in subsequent electrophilic reactions.

However, the reason is false. The activating effect of $-\text{NHCOCH}_3$ is actually less than that of the free $-\text{NH}_2$ group. In the acetamido group, the lone pair on nitrogen is partially delocalized into the carbonyl group of the acetyl part, reducing the electron-donating ability into the ring compared to the free amino group.

---

### Q17.
**Assertion (A):** The molecularity of the reaction $\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr}$ appears to be 2.

**Reason (R):** Two molecules of the reactants are involved in the given elementary reaction.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** Molecularity is defined as the number of reacting species (atoms, ions, or molecules) that collide simultaneously in an elementary reaction step. For the reaction $\text{H}_2 + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{HBr}$, if considered as an elementary reaction, one molecule of H₂ and one molecule of Br₂ collide, giving a molecularity of 2 (bimolecular). The reason correctly explains that two molecules are involved in the elementary step, making it the correct explanation of the assertion. Hence option (a) is correct.

---

### Q18.
**Assertion (A):** Low spin tetrahedral complexes are rarely observed.

**Reason (R):** Crystal field splitting energy is less than pairing energy for tetrahedral complexes.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** In tetrahedral complexes, the crystal field splitting energy ($\Delta_t$) is only $\frac{4}{9}$ of the octahedral splitting energy ($\Delta_o$) for the same metal and ligands. This small value of $\Delta_t$ means it is almost always less than the pairing energy ($P$). When $\Delta_t < P$, electrons prefer to occupy higher energy orbitals individually rather than pair up in lower energy orbitals, resulting in high spin configurations. Since low spin requires $\Delta > P$, and this condition is rarely met in tetrahedral complexes, low spin tetrahedral complexes are rarely observed. The reason correctly explains the assertion.

### Q19.
What is Henry's law? Give one application of it.

**Answer:**

**Henry's Law:** Henry's law states that at constant temperature, the solubility (or the partial pressure) of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. Mathematically:
$$p = K_H \cdot x$$
where $p$ is the partial pressure of the gas, $K_H$ is Henry's law constant, and $x$ is the mole fraction of the gas in the solution.

**Application:** Henry's law is used in the carbonated beverage industry. Carbon dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) is dissolved in beverages under high pressure. When the bottle is opened, the pressure decreases, and $\text{CO}_2$ escapes from the solution, causing effervescence (fizzing). Other applications include:
- Understanding the condition of anoxia and altitude sickness (at high altitude, low partial pressure of O₂ leads to less O₂ dissolving in blood).
- Scuba diving (to understand the effect of high pressure on gas solubility in blood).

### Q20.

**(a)** On diluting two electrolytes 'A' and 'B', the $\Lambda_m$ of 'A' increases 25 times while that of 'B' increases by 1.5 times. Which of the two electrolytes is strong? Justify your answer graphically.

**Answer:**

**'B' is the strong electrolyte.**

**Explanation:** Strong electrolytes are already almost completely dissociated at moderate concentrations. Upon dilution, their molar conductivity increases only slightly (by a small amount) because the interionic interactions decrease. Weak electrolytes, on the other hand, show a dramatic increase in molar conductivity upon dilution because dilution promotes dissociation significantly.

Since the $\Lambda_m$ of 'A' increases 25 times (a very large increase) upon dilution, 'A' is a **weak electrolyte**. Since the $\Lambda_m$ of 'B' increases by only 1.5 times (a small increase), 'B' is the **strong electrolyte**.

[Diagram: A graph of $\Lambda_m$ vs $\sqrt{c}$ showing two curves — Curve B (strong electrolyte) is nearly linear with a small slope, starting from a high value and reaching $\Lambda_m^\circ$ with a small increase. Curve A (weak electrolyte) starts at a low value and rises steeply at low concentrations, showing a large increase in $\Lambda_m$ upon dilution. Both curves approach $\Lambda_m^\circ$ at infinite dilution.]

**OR**

**(b)** The electrical resistance of a column of $0.05\ \text{mol L}^{-1}$ NaOH solution of diameter 1 cm and length 50 cm is $5.55 \times 10^3\ \Omega$. Calculate the conductivity.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Resistance, $R = 5.55 \times 10^3\ \Omega$
- Length, $l = 50\ \text{cm} = 0.50\ \text{m}$
- Diameter $= 1\ \text{cm}$, so radius $= 0.5\ \text{cm} = 0.005\ \text{m}$

**Cross-sectional area:**
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (0.5)^2 = 0.7854\ \text{cm}^2 = 0.7854 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{m}^2$$

**Conductivity** is given by:
$$\kappa = \frac{1}{R} \times \frac{l}{A}$$

$$\kappa = \frac{1}{5.55 \times 10^3} \times \frac{50\ \text{cm}}{0.7854\ \text{cm}^2}$$

$$\kappa = \frac{1}{5.55 \times 10^3} \times 63.66\ \text{cm}^{-1}$$

$$\kappa = \frac{63.66}{5550}\ \text{S cm}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{\kappa \approx 0.01147\ \text{S cm}^{-1}}$$

### Q21.
Complete the following equations:

**(a)** $2\text{MnO}_4^- + 5\text{NO}_2^- + 6\text{H}^+ \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

$$2\text{MnO}_4^- + 5\text{NO}_2^- + 6\text{H}^+ \rightarrow 2\text{Mn}^{2+} + 5\text{NO}_3^- + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Solution:** Permanganate ($\text{MnO}_4^-$) acts as an oxidising agent in acidic medium, being reduced from Mn(+7) to Mn(+2). Nitrite ($\text{NO}_2^-$) is oxidised to nitrate ($\text{NO}_3^-$), with N going from +3 to +5. Balancing electrons: each $\text{MnO}_4^-$ gains 5 electrons, and each $\text{NO}_2^-$ loses 2 electrons. Using LCM: 2 $\text{MnO}_4^-$ gain 10 electrons and 5 $\text{NO}_2^-$ lose 10 electrons. Balancing H and O with H⁺ and H₂O gives the equation above.

---

**(b)** $\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} + 14\text{H}^+ + 6e^- \rightarrow$

**Answer:**

$$\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-} + 14\text{H}^+ + 6e^- \rightarrow 2\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Solution:** Dichromate ion ($\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7^{2-}$) is reduced in acidic medium. Each Cr goes from +6 to +3, a gain of 3 electrons per Cr atom, so 6 electrons total for 2 Cr atoms. The 7 oxygen atoms combine with 14 H⁺ to form 7 H₂O molecules.

---

### Q22.

**(a)** Identify 'A' and 'B' in the following reactions:

$$\text{CH}_3-\underset{|}{\overset{}{\text{CH}}}-\text{CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{PCl}_5} \text{'A'} \xrightarrow{\text{AgCN}} \text{'B'}$$
$$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{OH}$$

**Answer:**

- **A:** $\text{CH}_3\text{-CH(Cl)-CH}_3$ (2-chloropropane)
- **B:** $\text{CH}_3\text{-CH(CN)-CH}_3$ (2-methylpropionitrile / 2-methylpropanenitrile)

**Solution:**
- Step 1: 2-propanol reacts with $\text{PCl}_5$ to give 2-chloropropane (A) via substitution of the $-\text{OH}$ group by $-\text{Cl}$.
- Step 2: 2-chloropropane reacts with AgCN (which provides $\text{CN}^-$ as a nucleophile) to give 2-methylpropanenitrile (B) via an $S_N2$ reaction. AgCN reacts through carbon of CN⁻, giving a nitrile.

*(Note: The final product B on hydrolysis or reduction would give an amine, but as written, B is the nitrile.)*

---

**(b)** Identify 'A' and 'B' in the following reactions:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Cl} \xrightarrow{\text{KOH (ethanol)}} \text{'A'} \xrightarrow{\text{HBr}} \text{'B'}$$

**Answer:**

- **A:** $\text{CH}_3\text{CH=CH}_2$ (Propene)
- **B:** $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Br}$ (1-bromopropane)

**Solution:**
- Step 1: n-propyl chloride undergoes elimination (E2) with alcoholic KOH to give propene (A).
- Step 2: Propene reacts with HBr. Addition of HBr to propene follows Markovnikov's rule — H adds to C₁ (the carbon with more H atoms) and Br adds to C₂. However, this would give 2-bromopropane. Since 'B' is shown as the anti-Markovnikov product $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Br}$ in the original paper context, this could occur under peroxide conditions (free radical addition). Under normal ionic conditions, Markovnikov product ($\text{CH}_3\text{CHBrCH}_3$) is expected. Per the document solution: B is $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Br}$.

---

### Q23.

**(a)** Account for the following:

**(i)** Phenol is a stronger acid than an alcohol.

**Answer:**

Phenol is a stronger acid than alcohol because the phenoxide ion ($\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{O}^-$) formed after loss of a proton ($\text{H}^+$) is stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring. The negative charge on the oxygen is delocalized over the ring through resonance, making the phenoxide ion more stable. In contrast, the alkoxide ion ($\text{RO}^-$) formed from alcohols has no such resonance stabilization and is therefore less stable, making alcohols weaker acids. Greater stability of the conjugate base means greater acid strength, so phenol is a stronger acid than alcohols.

---

**(ii)** The boiling point of alcohols decreases with increase in branching of the alkyl chain.

**Answer:**

As branching in the alkyl chain increases, the shape of the molecule becomes more spherical and compact, which reduces the surface area available for intermolecular contact. Decreased surface area leads to weaker London dispersion forces (Van der Waals forces) between the molecules. Since less energy is required to overcome these weaker intermolecular forces, the boiling point decreases with increasing branching.

**OR**

**(b)**

**(i)** Write the mechanism of the following reaction:

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+,\ 443\text{ K}} \text{CH}_2{=}\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

**Answer:**

The mechanism is an acid-catalysed dehydration (E1) proceeding in three steps:

**Step 1 — Protonation of ethanol:**
$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\overset{+}{\text{OH}}_2$$
The oxygen of ethanol is protonated by the acid to form an oxonium ion.

**Step 2 — Formation of carbocation:**
$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\overset{+}{\text{OH}}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\overset{+}{\text{CH}}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
Water leaves as a good leaving group, generating a primary carbocation (ethyl carbocation).

**Step 3 — Loss of proton to form alkene:**
$$\text{CH}_3\overset{+}{\text{CH}}_2 \rightarrow \text{CH}_2{=}\text{CH}_2 + \text{H}^+$$
A proton is lost from the adjacent carbon, forming the double bond and regenerating the acid catalyst.

---

**(ii)** Write the equation involved in Reimer-Tiemann reaction.

**Answer:**

In the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, phenol reacts with chloroform ($\text{CHCl}_3$) in the presence of aqueous NaOH to give ortho-hydroxy benzaldehyde (salicylaldehyde) as the major product:

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} + \text{CHCl}_3 + 3\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_4(\text{CHO})(\text{OH}) + 3\text{NaCl} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

The reactive intermediate is dichlorocarbene ($:\text{CCl}_2$), formed from chloroform and NaOH, which attacks the ortho position of the phenoxide ion.

---

### Q24.
Explain briefly:

**(a)** Carbylamine reaction

**Answer:**

The carbylamine reaction (also called the isocyanide test) involves the reaction of a **primary amine** (aliphatic or aromatic) with chloroform ($\text{CHCl}_3$) and alcoholic potassium hydroxide ($\text{KOH}$) to give an isocyanide (carbylamine), which has an extremely unpleasant odour:

$$\text{R-NH}_2 + \text{CHCl}_3 + 3\text{KOH}(\text{alc.}) \rightarrow \text{R-NC} + 3\text{KCl} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$$

This reaction is used as a test to distinguish primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines, as only primary amines give a positive carbylamine test. The formation of the foul-smelling isocyanide confirms the presence of a primary amine.

---

**(b)** Gabriel phthalimide synthesis

**Answer:**

Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is a method for the preparation of **primary aliphatic amines** free from secondary and tertiary amines.

**Steps:**
1. Phthalimide is treated with alcoholic KOH to form potassium phthalimide (a nucleophile):
$$\text{Phthalimide} + \text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{Potassium phthalimide} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
2. Potassium phthalimide reacts with an alkyl halide ($\text{R-X}$) via $S_N2$ reaction to give N-alkylphthalimide:
$$\text{Potassium phthalimide} + \text{R-X} \rightarrow \text{N-alkylphthalimide} + \text{KX}$$
3. N-alkylphthalimide is hydrolysed with dilute acid or alkali (or hydrazine) to yield the primary amine:
$$\text{N-alkylphthalimide} + \text{H}_2\text{O}/\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{R-NH}_2 + \text{Phthalic acid}$$

This method cannot be used to prepare aromatic primary amines because aryl halides do not undergo $S_N2$ reactions.

---

### Q25.

**(a)** Write chemical reactions to show that the open structure of D-glucose contains the straight chain.

**Answer:**

The straight-chain (open) structure of D-glucose is confirmed by the following reactions:

**Reaction with HCN (addition to all 5 carbons in chain):**
$$\text{D-Glucose} + \text{HCN} \rightarrow \text{Glucose cyanohydrin}$$
This shows the presence of an aldehyde group at one end and establishes the chain structure.

**Reaction with hydroxylamine ($\text{NH}_2\text{OH}$):**
$$\text{D-Glucose} + \text{NH}_2\text{OH} \rightarrow \text{Glucose oxime} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
This confirms the presence of the aldehyde (or carbonyl) group.

**Acylation:** Glucose reacts with acetic anhydride to give glucose pentaacetate, confirming the presence of five $-\text{OH}$ groups in the straight chain.

**Oxidation with Br₂ water:** Glucose is oxidised to gluconic acid, confirming the presence of an aldehyde group:
$$\text{D-Glucose} + \text{Br}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Gluconic acid}$$

These reactions collectively confirm the open straight-chain structure of D-glucose.

---

**(b)** What type of linkage is responsible for the formation of protein?

**Answer:**

**Peptide linkage** (also called amide bond or peptide bond) is responsible for the formation of proteins. It is formed by the condensation reaction between the $-\text{COOH}$ (carboxyl) group of one amino acid and the $-\text{NH}_2$ (amino) group of another amino acid, with the elimination of a water molecule:

$$-\text{COOH} + \text{H}_2\text{N}- \rightarrow -\text{CO-NH}- + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

The resulting $-\text{CO-NH}-$ bond is the peptide linkage. Proteins are polypeptides made up of many amino acid units linked by these peptide bonds.

**(a)** Differentiate between Ideal solution and Non-ideal solution.

**Answer:**

| Property | Ideal Solution | Non-ideal Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Raoult's Law | Obeys Raoult's law at all concentrations and temperatures | Deviates from Raoult's law (positive or negative deviation) |
| $\Delta H_{\text{mix}}$ | $\Delta H_{\text{mix}} = 0$ (no heat is absorbed or evolved on mixing) | $\Delta H_{\text{mix}} \neq 0$ (heat is absorbed or evolved) |
| $\Delta V_{\text{mix}}$ | $\Delta V_{\text{mix}} = 0$ (no change in volume on mixing) | $\Delta V_{\text{mix}} \neq 0$ (change in volume occurs) |
| Intermolecular forces | Solute-solvent interactions are similar to solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions | Solute-solvent interactions differ from solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions |
| Example | Benzene + toluene; $n$-hexane + $n$-heptane | Ethanol + water (positive deviation); acetone + chloroform (negative deviation) |

**(b)** 30 g of urea is dissolved in 846 g of water. Calculate the vapour pressure of water for this solution if vapour pressure of pure water at 298 K is 23.8 mm Hg.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Mass of urea = 30 g, Molar mass of urea $(\text{NH}_2\text{CONH}_2)$ = 60 g/mol
- Mass of water = 846 g, Molar mass of water = 18 g/mol
- $P^\circ_{\text{water}} = 23.8\ \text{mm Hg}$

**Moles of urea:**
$$n_{\text{urea}} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5\ \text{mol}$$

**Moles of water:**
$$n_{\text{water}} = \frac{846}{18} = 47\ \text{mol}$$

**Mole fraction of water:**
$$X_{\text{water}} = \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{water}} + n_{\text{urea}}} = \frac{47}{47 + 0.5} = \frac{47}{47.5} = 0.9895$$

**Vapour pressure of water over solution (Raoult's law):**
$$P_{\text{solution}} = X_{\text{water}} \times P^\circ_{\text{water}}$$

$$P_{\text{solution}} = 0.9895 \times 23.8 = 23.55\ \text{mm Hg}$$

$$\boxed{P_{\text{solution}} \approx 23.55\ \text{mm Hg}}$$

### Q27.
Write the main product formed when:

**(a)** Methyl chloride is treated with NaI/Acetone.

**Answer:** $\text{CH}_3\text{I}$ (Methyl iodide / Iodomethane)

**Solution:** This is the **Finkelstein reaction**. When alkyl chlorides or bromides are treated with NaI in dry acetone, the chloride or bromide is replaced by iodide:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{Cl} + \text{NaI} \xrightarrow{\text{Acetone}} \text{CH}_3\text{I} + \text{NaCl}$$
NaCl is insoluble in acetone and precipitates out, driving the equilibrium forward.

---

**(b)** 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene is subjected to hydrolysis.

**Answer:** **2,4,6-Trinitrophenol** (Picric acid)

**Solution:** 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorobenzene undergoes nucleophilic aromatic substitution ($S_N\text{Ar}$) with water (hydrolysis). The three electron-withdrawing nitro groups at ortho and para positions strongly activate the ring towards nucleophilic attack. The chloride ion is displaced by the hydroxide ion:
$$2,4,6\text{-Cl-C}_6\text{H}_2(\text{NO}_2)_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2,4,6\text{-}(\text{NO}_2)_3\text{C}_6\text{H}_2\text{OH} + \text{HCl}$$

---

**(c)** n-Butyl chloride is treated with alcoholic KOH.

**Answer:** **1-Butene** ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH=CH}_2$)

**Solution:** n-Butyl chloride ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Cl}$) undergoes E2 elimination when treated with alcoholic KOH. The KOH acts as a strong base, abstracting a $\beta$-hydrogen, and the chloride leaves, forming a double bond:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{Cl} + \text{KOH(alc.)} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH=CH}_2 + \text{KCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

---

### Q28.
How do you convert the following: (Any three)

**(a)** Phenol to Picric acid

**Answer:**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{conc. HNO}_3 / \text{conc. H}_2\text{SO}_4} 2,4,6\text{-}(\text{NO}_2)_3\text{C}_6\text{H}_2\text{OH}$$

Phenol is treated with concentrated nitric acid (in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid) to undergo electrophilic nitration three times at the 2, 4, and 6 positions, yielding 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid).

---

**(b)** Propanone to 2-Methylpropan-2-ol

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3 \xrightarrow{(i)\ \text{CH}_3\text{MgBr},\ \text{dry ether}} \xrightarrow{(ii)\ \text{H}_3\text{O}^+} (\text{CH}_3)_3\text{COH}$$

Propanone reacts with methylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent), followed by hydrolysis with dilute acid, to give 2-methylpropan-2-ol (a tertiary alcohol).

---

**(c)** Phenol to Anisole

**Answer:**

$$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OH} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOH}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{ONa} \xrightarrow{\text{CH}_3\text{I}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{OCH}_3 + \text{NaI}$$

Phenol is first treated with NaOH to form sodium phenoxide. Sodium phenoxide then reacts with methyl iodide ($\text{CH}_3\text{I}$) via Williamson synthesis to give anisole (methoxybenzene).

---

**(d)** Propene to Propan-1-ol

**Answer:**

$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH=CH}_2 \xrightarrow{(i)\ \text{B}_2\text{H}_6} \xrightarrow{(ii)\ \text{H}_2\text{O}_2/\text{NaOH}} \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$$

Propene undergoes hydroboration-oxidation (anti-Markovnikov addition of water) using diborane ($\text{B}_2\text{H}_6$) followed by treatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. This gives propan-1-ol (the alcohol with $-\text{OH}$ at the less substituted/terminal carbon).

---

### Q29.

**(a)** Explain why:

**(i)** Carboxyl group in benzoic acid is meta-directing.

**Answer:**

The carboxyl group ($-\text{COOH}$) is a meta-director in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. The $\text{C=O}$ of the carboxyl group is electron-withdrawing through both the inductive effect and resonance effect. When the resonance structures of the intermediate carbocation (during electrophilic attack) are drawn, the ortho and para attack intermediates place the positive charge adjacent to the electron-withdrawing $-\text{COOH}$ group, further destabilizing these intermediates. The meta attack intermediate does not have this destabilization. Therefore, the meta position is relatively more electron-rich and the electrophile preferentially attacks the meta position, making $-\text{COOH}$ a meta-director (and a deactivating group).

---

**(ii)** Sodium bisulphite is used for the purification of aldehydes and ketones.

**Answer:**

Sodium bisulphite ($\text{NaHSO}_3$) forms crystalline bisulphite adducts with aldehydes and methyl ketones through nucleophilic addition:
$$\text{R-CHO} + \text{NaHSO}_3 \rightarrow \text{R-CH(OH)SO}_3\text{Na}$$
These adducts are crystalline solids that are insoluble in excess sodium bisulphite solution and can be easily filtered. The adduct is then decomposed by treatment with dilute acid (or dilute alkali) to regenerate the pure aldehyde or ketone. This allows aldehydes and ketones to be separated from impurities (which do not form bisulphite adducts) and hence is used for their purification.

---

**(iii)** Carboxylic acids do not give characteristic reactions of the carbonyl group.

**Answer:**

In carboxylic acids ($-\text{COOH}$), the carbonyl carbon ($\text{C=O}$) is directly bonded to a hydroxyl group ($-\text{OH}$). The lone pair of electrons on the oxygen of the $-\text{OH}$ group is delocalized into the $\text{C=O}$ group through resonance, increasing the electron density on the carbonyl carbon. This makes the carbonyl carbon of $-\text{COOH}$ less electrophilic (less susceptible to nucleophilic attack) compared to the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones. Therefore, carboxylic acids do not undergo typical carbonyl reactions such as nucleophilic addition reactions with HCN, Grignard reagents, etc.

**OR**

**(b)** An organic compound 'A', having the molecular formula $\text{C}_3\text{H}_6\text{O}$ on treatment with Cu at 573 K, gives 'B'. 'B' does not reduce Fehling's solution but gives a yellow precipitate of compound 'C' with $\text{I}_2/\text{NaOH}$. Deduce the structures of A, B, and C.

**Answer:**

**Analysis:**

- Molecular formula $\text{C}_3\text{H}_6\text{O}$ with degree of unsaturation = 1, suggesting a carbonyl compound or a ring.
- Treatment with Cu at 573 K (catalytic dehydrogenation/oxidation): if A is a secondary alcohol, Cu oxidises it to a ketone; if A is a primary alcohol, Cu oxidises it to an aldehyde.
- B does not reduce Fehling's solution → B is **not an aldehyde** → B is a ketone.
- B gives yellow precipitate with $\text{I}_2/\text{NaOH}$ (iodoform test) → B contains the $\text{CH}_3\text{CO}-$ group → B is **propanone** ($\text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3$).
- Since B is propanone (a ketone), A must be a secondary alcohol: **propan-2-ol** ($\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_3$).
- C is the yellow precipitate in the iodoform test: **iodoform** ($\text{CHI}_3$).

**Structures:**
- **A:** $\text{CH}_3\text{-CH(OH)-CH}_3$ (Propan-2-ol)
- **B:** $\text{CH}_3\text{-CO-CH}_3$ (Propanone / Acetone)
- **C:** $\text{CHI}_3$ (Iodoform)

**Reactions:**
$$\text{CH}_3\text{CH(OH)CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{Cu},\ 573\text{ K}} \text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{I}_2/\text{NaOH}} \text{CHI}_3\downarrow + \text{CH}_3\text{COONa}$$

### Q30.

**(a)** What are the hydrolysis products of (i) Lactose, (ii) Maltose?

**Answer:**

**(i) Lactose:** On hydrolysis, lactose yields one molecule of **D-glucose** and one molecule of **D-galactose**:
$$\text{Lactose} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+/\text{H}_2\text{O or lactase}} \text{D-Glucose} + \text{D-Galactose}$$
Lactose is a disaccharide with a $\beta$-1,4-glycosidic linkage between galactose (C₁) and glucose (C₄).

**(ii) Maltose:** On hydrolysis, maltose yields **two molecules of D-glucose**:
$$\text{Maltose} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+/\text{H}_2\text{O or maltase}} 2\ \text{D-Glucose}$$
Maltose is a disaccharide with an $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic linkage between two glucose units.

---

**(b)** Give the basic structural difference between starch and cellulose.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Starch | Cellulose |
|---|---|---|
| Monomer | $\alpha$-D-Glucose | $\beta$-D-Glucose |
| Glycosidic linkage | $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic bonds (amylose); $\alpha$-1,4 and $\alpha$-1,6 (amylopectin) | $\beta$-1,4-glycosidic bonds |
| Structure | Helical (amylose) or branched (amylopectin) | Linear, unbranched, fibrous |
| Function | Energy storage in plants | Structural component of plant cell walls |
| Digestibility | Digestible by humans | Not digestible by humans (no $\beta$-glucosidase) |

The fundamental difference is: starch consists of $\alpha$-glucose units joined by $\alpha$-1,4-glycosidic bonds (with $\alpha$-1,6 at branch points in amylopectin), forming a helical/branched structure; cellulose consists of $\beta$-glucose units joined by $\beta$-1,4-glycosidic bonds, forming a straight-chain fibrous structure stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

## Section D — Case-Based Questions

### Q31.

**Case:** The rate of reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a given interval of time. Mathematical representation of rate of reaction is given by rate law. Rate constant and order of a reaction can be determined from rate law or its integrated rate equation.

**(i)** What is the average rate of reaction?

**Answer:**

The **average rate of reaction** is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant (decrease) or product (increase) divided by the time interval over which the change occurs:

$$\text{Average rate} = -\frac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta t} = +\frac{\Delta[\text{Product}]}{\Delta t}$$

It gives the rate of reaction over a finite time interval and does not provide information about the rate at any specific instant.

---

**(ii)** Write two factors that affect the rate of reaction.

**Answer:**

1. **Temperature:** Increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction, as a greater fraction of molecules have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy (Arrhenius equation: $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$).

2. **Concentration of reactants:** Increasing the concentration of reactants generally increases the rate of reaction, as more molecules are available for effective collisions per unit volume (as expressed in the rate law: $\text{Rate} = k[\text{A}]^m[\text{B}]^n$).

*(Other valid factors: presence of catalyst, surface area for heterogeneous reactions, nature of reactants.)*

---

**(iii)**

**(1)** What happens to the rate of reaction for a zero-order reaction?

**Answer:**

For a **zero-order reaction**, the rate is **constant** and **independent of the concentration** of the reactants:
$$\text{Rate} = k[\text{A}]^0 = k$$
The rate remains unchanged regardless of how much the concentration of the reactant changes. The rate equals the rate constant $k$. The concentration of reactant decreases linearly with time.

---

**(2)** What is the unit of $k$ for a zero-order reaction?

**Answer:**

For a zero-order reaction:
$$\text{Rate} = k$$

Since rate has units of $\text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$ (or $\text{M s}^{-1}$):
$$k = \frac{\text{Rate}}{[\text{A}]^0} = \text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{[\text{k for zero-order}] = \text{mol L}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}\ (\text{or M s}^{-1})}$$

**OR**

**(iii)**

**(1)** For a reaction $\text{P} + 2\text{Q} \rightarrow \text{Products}$, Rate $= k[\text{P}]^{1/2}[\text{Q}]^1$. What is the order of the reaction?

**Answer:**

The **order of the reaction** is the sum of the powers (exponents) of the concentration terms in the rate law:

$$\text{Order} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$

The reaction is of **1.5th order** (three-halves order) overall.

---

**(2)** Define pseudo first-order reaction with an example.

**Answer:**

A **pseudo first-order reaction** is a reaction that is actually of higher order (second order or more) but experimentally behaves as a first-order reaction because the concentration of one or more of the reactants is present in such large excess that it remains effectively constant throughout the reaction. The rate then appears to depend only on the concentration of the other reactant.

**Example:** Hydrolysis of an ester in dilute aqueous solution:
$$\text{CH}_3\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+} \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{C}_2\text{H}_5\text{OH}$$

This is actually a second-order reaction (first order in ester and first order in water), but since water is present in vast excess, its concentration remains nearly constant. The rate becomes:
$$\text{Rate} = k'[\text{CH}_3\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5]$$
where $k' = k[\text{H}_2\text{O}]$ is the pseudo first-order rate constant. The reaction thus behaves as first order.

---

### Q32.

**Case:** In coordination compounds, metals show two types of linkages, primary and secondary. Primary valencies are ionisable and are satisfied by negatively charged ions. Secondary valencies are non-ionisable and are satisfied by neutral or negative ions having lone pair of electrons. Primary valencies are non-directional while secondary valencies decide the shape of the complexes.

**(i)** If $\text{PtCl}_2 \cdot 2\text{NH}_3$ does not react with $\text{AgNO}_3$, what will be its formula?

**Answer:**

If the compound does not react with $\text{AgNO}_3$, it means there are **no free (ionisable) chloride ions** — all chloride ions are within the coordination sphere (satisfying secondary valency). Therefore, both $\text{Cl}^-$ ions and both $\text{NH}_3$ molecules are inside the square brackets:

$$\boxed{[\text{Pt}(\text{NH}_3)_2\text{Cl}_2]}$$

This is the neutral square planar complex with no counter ions. Pt is in the +2 oxidation state.

---

**(ii)** What is the secondary valency of $[\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$?

**Answer:**

In $[\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$, ethylenediamine (en) is a bidentate ligand — each molecule of en donates 2 lone pairs to the central metal Co. With 3 molecules of en, the total number of donor atoms coordinated to Co is:
$$3 \times 2 = 6$$

The **secondary valency (coordination number)** of Co in $[\text{Co(en)}_3]^{3+}$ is **6**.

---

**(iii)** Write the formula of Iron(III)hexacyanidoferrate(II).

**Answer:**

- Iron(III) = $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ (the counter cation outside the complex)
- Hexacyanidoferrate(II) = $[\text{Fe}(\text{CN})_6]^{4-}$ (iron in +2 state with 6 CN⁻ ligands; overall charge: $+2 - 6 = -4$)

Balancing charges: $3 \times (+3)$ from Fe³⁺ and $4 \times (-4)$ from $[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}$... we need: $3 \times (+3) = +9$ and to neutralize with $[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}$: we need $\frac{9}{4}$, so multiply: $4 \times \text{Fe}^{3+}$ gives $+12$ charge and $3 \times [\text{Fe(CN)}_6]^{4-}$ gives $-12$:

$$\boxed{\text{Fe}_4[\text{Fe(CN)}_6]_3}$$

This is Prussian blue (iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate(II)).

---

**(iv)** Write the IUPAC name of $[\text{Co}(\text{NH}_3)_5\text{Cl}]\text{Cl}_2$.

**Answer:**

- Central metal: Co
- Ligands inside the bracket: 5 $\text{NH}_3$ (ammine) and 1 $\text{Cl}^-$ (chlorido)
- Oxidation state of Co: Let it be $x$. $x + 0(5) + (-1)(1) = +1$ (charge of complex ion) → $x = +3$, i.e., Co(III)
- Counter ions: 2 $\text{Cl}^-$ (named as chloride at the end)
- Ligands named alphabetically: chlorido, pentaammine

$$\boxed{\text{Pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride}}$$

**OR**

**(iii)** Write the hybridization and magnetic behaviour of $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$. (Atomic number: Ni = 28)

**Answer:**

- Electronic configuration of Ni: $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^8\ 4s^2$
- Ni in $[\text{Ni(CN)}_4]^{2-}$: Ni is in +2 state → $\text{Ni}^{2+}$: $[\text{Ar}]\ 3d^8$
- CN⁻ is a strong field ligand → causes pairing of electrons
- $3d^8$ with strong field: electrons pair up in $3d$ to give configuration: $3d^8$ → $\underbrace{\uparrow\downarrow\ \uparrow\downarrow\ \uparrow\downarrow\ \uparrow\downarrow}_{3d}$ (all 8 electrons paired in 4 orbitals, one $3d$ orbital becomes empty)

With one empty $3d$ orbital available, hybridization is $dsp^2$ (one $3d$, one $4s$, two $4p$ orbitals):

$$\text{Hybridization: } dsp^2$$

$$\text{Geometry: Square planar}$$

Since all electrons are paired (no unpaired electrons):

$$\text{Magnetic behaviour: Diamagnetic}$$

[Diagram: $\text{Ni}^{2+}$ with $3d$ orbitals showing 4 pairs of electrons in four $3d$ orbitals and one empty $3d$ orbital used in $dsp^2$ hybridization]

### Q33.

**(a)**

**(i)** State Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions. Write an expression for the limiting molar conductivity of acetic acid according to Kohlrausch's law.

**Answer:**

**Kohlrausch's Law of Independent Migration of Ions:** At infinite dilution (limiting condition), the molar conductivity of an electrolyte can be expressed as the sum of the individual contributions of the cation and anion, and each ion makes a definite and independent contribution to the total molar conductivity regardless of the nature of the other ion present.

Mathematically:
$$\Lambda_m^\circ = \nu_+ \lambda_+^\circ + \nu_- \lambda_-^\circ$$

where $\nu_+$ and $\nu_-$ are the number of cations and anions per formula unit, and $\lambda_+^\circ$ and $\lambda_-^\circ$ are the limiting molar conductivities of the cation and anion respectively.

**Expression for acetic acid ($\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$):**

$$\Lambda_m^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}) = \lambda^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-) + \lambda^\circ(\text{H}^+)$$

This can also be expressed indirectly using strong electrolytes:
$$\Lambda_m^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}) = \Lambda_m^\circ(\text{CH}_3\text{COONa}) + \Lambda_m^\circ(\text{HCl}) - \Lambda_m^\circ(\text{NaCl})$$

---

**(ii)** Calculate the maximum work and $\log K_c$ for the given reaction at 298 K:

$$\text{Ni(s)} + 2\text{Ag}^+(\text{aq}) \rightarrow \text{Ni}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 2\text{Ag(s)}$$

Given: $E^\circ_{\text{Ni}^{2+}/\text{Ni}} = -0.25\ \text{V}$, $E
