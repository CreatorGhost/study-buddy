### Q1.
Photons of energies 1 eV and 2 eV are successively incident on a metallic surface of work function 0.5 eV. The ratio of kinetic energy of most energetic photoelectrons in the two cases will be:

(a) 1 : 2
(b) 1 : 1
(c) 1 : 3
(d) 1 : 4

**Answer:** (c) 1 : 3

**Solution:**
Using Einstein's photoelectric equation: $KE = E - W$

For the first photon ($E_1 = 1\ \text{eV}$):
$$KE_1 = E_1 - W = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\ \text{eV}$$

For the second photon ($E_2 = 2\ \text{eV}$):
$$KE_2 = E_2 - W = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5\ \text{eV}$$

Taking the ratio:
$$\frac{KE_1}{KE_2} = \frac{0.5}{1.5} = \frac{1}{3}$$

Therefore, the ratio is **1 : 3**.

### Q2.
Which of the following statements is **not** correct according to Rutherford's model?

(a) Most of the space inside an atom is empty
(b) The electrons revolve around the nucleus under the influence of Coulomb force acting on them
(c) Most part of the mass of the atom and its positive charge are concentrated at its center
(d) The stability of atom was established by the model

**Answer:** (d) The stability of atom was established by the model

**Solution:**
Option (d) is incorrect according to Rutherford's model because Rutherford was **not** able to explain the stability of the atom. According to classical electrodynamics, an accelerating electron (moving in a circular orbit) should continuously radiate energy and eventually spiral into the nucleus — a contradiction Rutherford's model could not resolve.

### Q3.
The resolving power of a telescope can be increased by increasing:

(a) Wavelength of light
(b) Diameter of objective
(c) Length of the tube
(d) Focal length of eyepiece

**Answer:** (b) Diameter of objective

**Solution:**
The resolving power of a telescope is given by:
$$\text{Resolving Power} = \frac{D}{1.22\lambda}$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the objective lens and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light. Resolving power can be increased by **decreasing** the wavelength or **increasing** the diameter of the objective lens. Hence, option (b) is correct.

### Q4.
The magnetic dipole moment of a current carrying coil does **not** depend upon:

(a) Number of turns of the coil
(b) Cross-sectional area of the coil
(c) Current flowing in the coil
(d) Material of the turns of the coil

**Answer:** (d) Material of the turns of the coil

**Solution:**
The magnetic dipole moment of a current carrying coil is given by:
$$M = NIA$$

where $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the current, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. It depends on $N$, $A$, and $I$, but **not** on the material of the turns. Hence, option (d) is correct.

---

### Q5.
For a glass prism, the angle of minimum deviation will be smallest for the light of:

(a) Red colour
(b) Blue colour
(c) Yellow colour
(d) Green colour

**Answer:** (a) Red colour

**Solution:**
The angle of minimum deviation depends on the refractive index of the prism material, which in turn depends on the wavelength of light (dispersion). Red light has the **maximum wavelength** among the given options and therefore the **smallest refractive index**, resulting in the **smallest angle of minimum deviation**.

---

### Q6.
A biconvex lens of glass having refractive index 1.47 is immersed in a liquid. It becomes invisible and behaves as a plane glass. The refractive index of the liquid is:

(a) 1.47
(b) 1.62
(c) 1.33
(d) 1.51

**Answer:** (a) 1.47

**Solution:**
According to the lens maker's formula:
$$\frac{1}{f} = \left(\frac{\mu_g}{\mu_l} - 1\right)\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$$

For the lens to behave as a plane sheet of glass (become invisible), $f = \infty$, which requires:
$$\frac{1}{f} = 0$$

This is possible only when:
$$\frac{\mu_g}{\mu_l} - 1 = 0 \implies \mu_g = \mu_l$$

Therefore:
$$\mu_l = \mu_g = 1.47$$

---

### Q7.
The resistance of a metal wire increases with increasing temperature on account of:

(a) Decrease in free electron density
(b) Decrease in relaxation time
(c) Increase in mean free path
(d) Increase in the mass of electron

**Answer:** (b) Decrease in relaxation time

**Solution:**
Relaxation time ($\tau$) is defined as the average time interval between two successive collisions of electrons in a conductor. The resistivity is given by:
$$\rho = \frac{m}{ne^2\tau}$$

As temperature increases, the thermal velocity of free electrons increases, leading to more frequent collisions between electrons and lattice ions. This results in a **decrease in relaxation time** $\tau$, which causes an **increase in resistance**. Hence, option (b) is correct.

---

### Q8.
An electric dipole placed in a non-uniform electric field can experience:

(a) A force but not a torque
(b) A torque but not a force
(c) Always a force and a torque
(d) Neither a force nor a torque

**Answer:** (c) Always a force and a torque

**Solution:**
An electric dipole always experiences a **torque** when placed in both uniform and non-uniform electric fields (unless aligned with the field). In a **non-uniform electric field**, the forces on the two charges of the dipole are unequal, so there is also a **net translational force** on the dipole. Therefore, in a non-uniform electric field, the dipole experiences **both a torque and a net force**.

---

### Q9.
If the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, then we can infer:

(a) No net charge is enclosed by the surface
(b) Uniform electric field exists within the surface
(c) Electric potential varies from point to point inside the surface
(d) Charge is present inside the surface

**Answer:** (a) No net charge is enclosed by the surface

**Solution:**
By Gauss's Law:
$$\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}$$

If the net electric flux $\phi = 0$, then $Q_{enc} = 0$, meaning **no net charge is enclosed** by the closed surface. Note that charges may still be present inside (positive and negative cancelling each other), but the net enclosed charge must be zero.

---

### Q10.
Kirchhoff's first rule at a junction in an electrical circuit is a statement of conservation of:

(a) Energy
(b) Charge
(c) Momentum
(d) Both energy and charge

**Answer:** (b) Charge

**Solution:**
Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), or first rule, states that the algebraic sum of all currents at a junction is zero:
$$\sum I = 0$$

This is based on the **conservation of charge** — charge cannot accumulate at a junction. Since current is the rate of flow of charge, conservation of current at a node implies conservation of charge.

### Q11.
A ray of light on passing through an equilateral glass prism suffers a minimum deviation equal to the angle of the prism. The value of refractive index of the material of the prism is __________.

**Answer:** $\sqrt{3}$

**Solution:**
For an equilateral prism, the angle of prism $A = 60°$.

Given that the minimum deviation $\delta_m = A = 60°$.

Using the formula for refractive index at minimum deviation:
$$\mu = \frac{\sin\left(\dfrac{A + \delta_m}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin\left(\dfrac{60° + 60°}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\dfrac{60°}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin 60°}{\sin 30°} = \frac{\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\dfrac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}$$

---

### Q12.
According to Bohr's atomic model, the circumference of the electron orbit is always an __________ multiple of de Broglie wavelength.

**Answer:** **Integral**

**Solution:**
According to Bohr's atomic model, an electron is considered as a standing wave along its circular orbit. For the wave to be continuous and non-destructive around the orbit, the circumference must be an **integral** multiple of the de Broglie wavelength:
$$2\pi r = n\lambda, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

**OR**

In $\beta$-decay, the parent and daughter nuclei have the same number of __________.

**Answer:** **Nucleons (mass number)**

**Solution:**
In $\beta$-decay, the mass number $A$ (total number of protons + neutrons) remains **unchanged**. A neutron converts to a proton (or vice versa), so the total nucleon count is conserved. The parent and daughter nuclei therefore have the same **mass number** (same number of nucleons).

---

### Q13.
The number of turns of a solenoid are doubled without changing its length and area of cross-section. The self-inductance of the solenoid will become __________ times.

**Answer:** **4 times**

**Solution:**
The self-inductance of a solenoid is given by:
$$L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l}$$

Since $L \propto N^2$, doubling the number of turns ($N \to 2N$) gives:
$$L' = \frac{\mu_0 (2N)^2 A}{l} = 4 \cdot \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l} = 4L$$

The self-inductance becomes **4 times** the original value.

---

### Q14.
Laminated iron sheets are used to minimize __________ in the core of a transformer.

**Answer:** **Eddy currents**

**Solution:**
Laminated iron sheets are used to minimize **eddy currents** in the core of a transformer. The thin insulated laminations interrupt the paths of eddy currents, thereby greatly reducing their magnitude and the associated energy losses (heat dissipation).

---

### Q15.
The magnetic field lines are __________ by a diamagnetic substance.

**Answer:** **Feebly repelled**

**Solution:**
Diamagnetic substances develop a feeble magnetisation in the **opposite direction** to the applied magnetic field. They are feebly repelled by magnets and tend to move from stronger to weaker regions of a magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field lines are **feebly repelled** by a diamagnetic substance.

---

### Q16.
Why cannot we use Si and Ge in the fabrication of visible LEDs?

**Answer:**
Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) are **indirect bandgap** semiconductors. When electron-hole recombination occurs in these materials, the energy released is predominantly in the form of **heat** (lattice vibrations/phonons) rather than light (photons). The photons emitted are in the **infrared region** and not in the visible spectrum. Therefore, Si and Ge cannot be used to fabricate visible LEDs. Materials like GaAs, GaP, etc. (direct bandgap semiconductors) are used instead.

---

### Q17.
The variation of the stopping potential of a photosensitive surface with the frequency ($\nu$) of the light incident on two different photosensitive surfaces $M_1$ and $M_2$ is shown in the figure. Identify the surface which has the greater value of the work function.

[Diagram: A graph with stopping potential $V_0$ on the y-axis and frequency $\nu$ on the x-axis. Two straight lines are shown — one for $M_1$ and one for $M_2$. Both lines have the same slope (since $h/e$ is constant), but $M_2$'s line intersects the x-axis at a higher frequency (threshold frequency) than $M_1$'s line.]

**Answer:** Surface **$M_2$** has the greater work function.

**Solution:**
The work function $\phi_0 = h\nu_0$, where $\nu_0$ is the threshold frequency (x-intercept of the $V_0$ vs $\nu$ graph). From the figure, $M_2$ has a higher threshold frequency ($\nu_2 > \nu_1$), so:
$$\phi_{0,M_2} = h\nu_2 > h\nu_1 = \phi_{0,M_1}$$

Therefore, surface **$M_2$** has the greater work function.

---

### Q18.
How does an increase in doping concentration affect the width of the depletion layer of a p-n junction diode?

**Answer:**
Increasing the doping concentration increases the number of majority charge carriers (holes on the p-side and electrons on the n-side). With more carriers available to diffuse across the junction and recombine, the built-in electric field increases more quickly, and equilibrium is reached with a **narrower depletion layer**. Therefore, an increase in doping concentration **decreases** the width of the depletion layer.

### Q19.
The nuclear radius of $^{27}_{13}\text{Al}$ is 4.6 fermi. Find the nuclear radius of $^{64}_{29}\text{Cu}$.

**Answer:** $R_{Cu} = 6.1\ \text{fermi}$

**Solution:**
The nuclear radius follows the relation:
$$R = R_0 A^{1/3}$$

Taking the ratio for Al and Cu:
$$\frac{R_{Al}}{R_{Cu}} = \left(\frac{A_{Al}}{A_{Cu}}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{27}{64}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{3}{4}$$

Therefore:
$$R_{Cu} = R_{Al} \times \frac{4}{3} = 4.6 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{18.4}{3} \approx 6.1\ \text{fermi}$$

**OR**

A proton and an electron have equal speed. Find the ratio of de Broglie wavelengths associated with them.

**Answer:** $\lambda_e : \lambda_p = 1836 : 1$

**Solution:**
The de Broglie wavelength is:
$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

Since both have the same speed $v$:
$$\lambda_e = \frac{h}{m_e v}, \qquad \lambda_p = \frac{h}{m_p v}$$

Taking the ratio:
$$\frac{\lambda_e}{\lambda_p} = \frac{m_p}{m_e} = \frac{1836\ m_e}{m_e} = 1836$$

Therefore:
$$\lambda_e : \lambda_p = 1836 : 1$$

---

### Q20.
How is displacement current produced between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor during charging?

**Answer:**
During charging, a time-varying electric field is set up between the plates of the capacitor. This time-varying electric field causes a time-varying electric flux between the plates. According to Maxwell, a changing electric flux gives rise to a current called the **displacement current**, given by:
$$I_d = \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

This displacement current flows between the plates and maintains continuity of current in the circuit, even in the absence of any physical charge flow through the gap.

### Q21.
Two long straight parallel wires A and B separated by a distance $d$, carry equal current $I$ flowing in the same direction as shown in the figure.

[Diagram: Two long parallel wires A (on the left) and B (on the right) separated by distance $d$. Both carry current $I$ coming out of the page (shown by ⊙). Point P lies between them at distance $x$ from wire A and $(d - x)$ from wire B. The horizontal axis shows $x$ from A and $d$ total separation.]

**(a)** Find the magnetic field at a point P situated between them at a distance $x$ from one wire.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The magnetic field due to wire A at point P (using right-hand rule, directed into the page below A, i.e., directed downward at P):
$$B_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi x}$$

The magnetic field due to wire B at point P (directed upward at P, i.e., opposing $B_1$):
$$B_2 = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi (d - x)}$$

Since the currents are in the same direction, $B_1$ and $B_2$ at P are in **opposite directions**. The net magnetic field is:
$$B = B_1 - B_2 = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}\left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{d-x}\right)$$

$$\boxed{B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}\left[\frac{d - 2x}{x(d-x)}\right]}$$

**(b)** Show graphically the variation of the magnetic field with distance $x$ for $0 < x < d$.

**Solution:**

[Diagram: A graph with magnetic field $B$ on the y-axis and position $x$ on the x-axis. For $x$ close to 0, $B$ is large and positive (dominated by wire A). As $x$ increases toward $d/2$, $B$ decreases to zero (at the midpoint, by symmetry). As $x$ increases beyond $d/2$ toward $d$, $B$ becomes negative (dominated by wire B) and its magnitude increases. The curve is antisymmetric about $x = d/2$, resembling a hyperbola passing through zero at $x = d/2$.]

### Q22.
Using Bohr's atomic model, derive the expression for the radius of the $n$th orbit of the revolving electron in a hydrogen atom.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
**Step 1 — Centripetal force balanced by Coulomb force:**

For a dynamically stable circular orbit, the electrostatic (Coulomb) force provides the centripetal force:
$$\frac{mv_n^2}{r_n} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{r_n^2}$$

$$\implies mv_n^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_n} \quad \cdots (1)$$

$$\implies v_n^2 = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m r_n} \implies v_n = \frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m r_n}} \quad \cdots (2)$$

**Step 2 — Bohr's quantisation condition:**

Angular momentum is quantised:
$$L_n = mv_n r_n = \frac{nh}{2\pi} \implies v_n = \frac{nh}{2\pi m r_n} \quad \cdots (3)$$

**Step 3 — Equating (2) and (3):**

$$\frac{e}{\sqrt{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m r_n}} = \frac{nh}{2\pi m r_n}$$

Squaring both sides:
$$\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m r_n} = \frac{n^2 h^2}{4\pi^2 m^2 r_n^2}$$

$$\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{n^2 h^2}{\pi m r_n}$$

$$\boxed{r_n = \frac{n^2 h^2 \varepsilon_0}{\pi m e^2}}$$

This can also be written as $r_n = n^2 a_0$, where $a_0 = \dfrac{h^2\varepsilon_0}{\pi m e^2} \approx 0.529\ \text{Å}$ is the Bohr radius.

**OR**

**(a)** Write two main observations of the photoelectric effect experiment which could only be explained by Einstein's photoelectric equation.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The two key observations are:

1. **Existence of threshold frequency:** There is a minimum frequency $\nu_0$ (threshold frequency) below which no photoelectron emission occurs, regardless of the intensity of incident light. This cannot be explained by the wave theory (which predicts emission at any frequency given sufficient intensity).

2. **Kinetic energy is independent of intensity:** The maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons depends **linearly on the frequency** of incident light ($KE_{max} = h\nu - \phi_0$) and is completely **independent of the intensity** of light. Wave theory predicts that higher intensity should give electrons more energy, which is contradicted by experiment.

**(b)** Draw the graph showing the variation of photocurrent with the anode potential of a photocell.

**Solution:**

[Diagram: A graph with photocurrent on the y-axis and anode potential $V$ on the x-axis. Three curves are shown for three different intensities $I_3 > I_2 > I_1$. All three curves share the same stopping potential $-V_0$ on the negative x-axis (showing stopping potential is independent of intensity). As anode potential increases, photocurrent rises and saturates at different saturation currents (higher intensity → higher saturation current). The x-axis intercept (stopping potential $-V_0$) is the same for all three curves.]

### Q23.
Define the wave front of a travelling wave. Using Huygens' principle, obtain the law of refraction at a plane interface when light passes from a rarer to a denser medium.

**Answer:**

**Definition:** A **wave front** is an imaginary surface over which an optical wave has a constant phase (all points on the wave front are in the same phase of oscillation). The shape of a wave front is determined by the geometry of the source (e.g., spherical for a point source, plane for a source at infinity).

**Derivation of Snell's Law using Huygens' Principle:**

[Diagram: A plane wavefront AB is incident on a planar interface between a rarer medium (refractive index $\mu_1$, speed $v_1$) above and a denser medium (refractive index $\mu_2$, speed $v_2$) below. The refracted wavefront is DC. Point A is on the interface; the incident ray makes angle $i$ with the normal and the refracted ray makes angle $r$. BC is the distance traveled by the wavefront in the rarer medium in time $\tau$ ($BC = v_1\tau$), and AD is the distance traveled in the denser medium in time $\tau$ ($AD = v_2\tau$). AC is the length along the interface.]

Let the incident wavefront AB strike the interface at A at $t = 0$. In time $\tau$:
- Point B of the wavefront travels to C in the rarer medium: $BC = v_1 \tau$
- The secondary wavelet from A travels to D in the denser medium: $AD = v_2 \tau$

DC is the refracted wavefront.

From geometry (using triangle ABC and triangle ADC):
$$\sin i = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{v_1 \tau}{AC}$$

$$\sin r = \frac{AD}{AC} = \frac{v_2 \tau}{AC}$$

Dividing:
$$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$$

Since $v \propto \dfrac{1}{\mu}$:

$$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} = \text{constant}$$

This is **Snell's Law** of refraction. ∎

**OR**

Using the lens maker's formula, derive the lens formula $\dfrac{1}{f} = \dfrac{1}{v} - \dfrac{1}{u}$ for a biconvex lens.

**Solution:**

[Diagram: A biconvex lens with object O on the left, optical centre at B (centre of lens), and final image I on the right. The first surface has centre of curvature $C_1$ and radius $R_1$; the second surface has centre of curvature $C_2$ and radius $R_2$. The intermediate image formed by the first surface (which acts as a virtual object for the second surface) is at $I_1$.]

**Refraction at the first surface (medium $n_1$ to $n_2$):**

Using the formula for refraction at a spherical surface:
$$\frac{n_1}{OB} + \frac{n_2}{BI_1} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{BC_1} \quad \cdots (1)$$

**Refraction at the second surface (medium $n_2$ to $n_1$):**

The image $I_1$ acts as a virtual object for the second surface:
$$-\frac{n_2}{DI_1} + \frac{n_1}{DI} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{DC_2} \quad \cdots (2)$$

Since the lens is thin, $BI_1 \approx DI_1$. **Adding equations (1) and (2):**

$$\frac{n_1}{OB} + \frac{n_1}{DI} = (n_2 - n_1)\left(\frac{1}{BC_1} + \frac{1}{DC_2}\right) \quad \cdots (3)$$

**For object at infinity** ($OB \to \infty$), the image is at the focus ($DI = f$):

$$\frac{n_1}{f} = (n_2 - n_1)\left(\frac{1}{BC_1} + \frac{1}{DC_2}\right) \quad \cdots (4)$$

**Dividing (3) by (4):**

$$\frac{n_1}{OB} + \frac{n_1}{DI} = \frac{n_1}{f}$$

Applying the sign convention ($OB = -u$, $DI = +v$):

$$\frac{n_1}{-u} + \frac{n_1}{v} = \frac{n_1}{f}$$

Dividing throughout by $n_1$:

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}}$$

This is the **lens formula**. ∎

### Q24.
Explain the principle of working of a meter bridge. Draw the circuit diagram for determination of an unknown resistance using it.

**Answer:**

**Principle:**
A meter bridge is a practical form of the Wheatstone bridge. It works on the principle that when the bridge is balanced (galvanometer reads zero), the ratio of the resistances of the two sections of the wire on either side of the jockey equals the ratio of the known resistance $R$ to the unknown resistance $S$:

$$\frac{R}{S} = \frac{Lr}{(100-L)r} = \frac{L}{100-L}$$

where $L$ is the balancing length from one end and $r$ is the resistance per unit length of the wire. Therefore:

$$S = \frac{100 - L}{L} \times R$$

[Diagram: A horizontal wire AC of length 100 cm mounted on a wooden board. A known resistance $R$ is connected between terminals on the left, and an unknown resistance $S$ between terminals on the right. A galvanometer $G$ is connected from the junction between $R$ and $S$ (point B) to a jockey that slides along the wire. A battery $E$ and key $K$ are connected across the ends A and C of the wire. The jockey is at position D at balancing length $l_1$ from A, so $AD = l_1$ and $DC = 100 - l_1$.]

### Q25.
Explain the terms 'depletion layer' and 'potential barrier' in a p-n junction diode. How are (a) the width of the depletion layer, and (b) the value of potential barrier affected when the p-n junction is forward biased?

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A p-n junction showing the p-region (with negative acceptor ions − and mobile holes +) on the left and the n-region (with positive donor ions + and mobile electrons −) on the right. The depletion region (devoid of mobile carriers) straddles the junction. An internal electric field $E$ points from n to p across the depletion region. A built-in potential $V_B$ is shown across the depletion layer.]

**Depletion Layer:**
When a p-n junction is formed, majority carriers (holes from p-side, electrons from n-side) diffuse across the junction and recombine, leaving behind immobile ionised donor and acceptor atoms. This region near the junction, which is devoid of free charge carriers and contains only immobile ions, is called the **depletion layer** (or depletion region).

**Potential Barrier:**
The immobile ions in the depletion region create a built-in electric field directed from the n-side to the p-side. This field opposes further diffusion of majority carriers and gives rise to a **potential barrier** (contact potential or built-in potential) across the junction — as if a fictitious battery with positive terminal at the n-side and negative terminal at the p-side were connected. Its value is approximately **0.3 V for Ge** and **0.7 V for Si**.

**Effect of Forward Bias:**

**(a) Width of depletion layer:**
In forward bias, the applied voltage opposes the built-in electric field, pushing majority carriers toward the junction. Holes are pushed toward the junction from the p-side and electrons from the n-side, causing recombination in the depletion region. This **reduces the width of the depletion layer**.

**(b) Value of potential barrier:**
The forward bias voltage directly opposes the built-in potential barrier, effectively **reducing the potential barrier**. When the applied forward voltage exceeds the barrier potential, significant current flows through the junction.

### Q26.
$N$ small conducting liquid droplets, each of radius $r$, are charged to a potential $V$ each. These droplets coalesce to form a single large drop without any charge leakage. Find the potential of the large drop.

**Answer:** $V' = N^{2/3}V$

**Solution:**

**Charge on each small droplet:**
$$V = \frac{kq}{r} \implies q = \frac{Vr}{k}$$

**Total charge on the large drop:**
$$Q = Nq = \frac{NVr}{k}$$

**Radius of the large drop** (volume conservation):
$$N \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \implies R = N^{1/3}r$$

**Potential of the large drop:**
$$V' = \frac{kQ}{R} = \frac{k \cdot \dfrac{NVr}{k}}{N^{1/3}r} = \frac{NVr}{N^{1/3}r}$$

$$\boxed{V' = N^{2/3}V}$$

### Q27.
Define activity of a sample of a radioactive substance. The value of the disintegration constant of a radioactive substance is $0.0693\ \text{h}^{-1}$. Find the time after which the activity of a sample of this substance reduces to one-half that of its present value.

**Answer:** $t_{1/2} = 10\ \text{hours}$

**Solution:**

**Definition:** The **activity** of a radioactive sample is defined as the number of disintegrations (decays) occurring per unit time. It is given by $A = \lambda N$, where $\lambda$ is the disintegration constant and $N$ is the number of undecayed nuclei. Its SI unit is the **Becquerel (Bq)**.

**Calculation of half-life:**
The time for the activity (or number of nuclei) to reduce to half its present value is the **half-life** $t_{1/2}$:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{\lambda}$$

Substituting $\lambda = 0.0693\ \text{h}^{-1}$:

$$t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{0.0693\ \text{h}^{-1}} = 10\ \text{hours}$$

### Q28.
In a single slit diffraction experiment, light of wavelength $\lambda$ illuminates a slit of width $a$ and the diffraction pattern is observed on a screen.

**(a)** Show the intensity distribution in the pattern with the angular position $\theta$.

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Intensity vs angular position $\theta$ graph for single-slit diffraction. A tall central maximum is at $\theta = 0$. Secondary maxima of diminishing intensity appear symmetrically at approximately $\theta \approx \pm 3\lambda/2a,\ \pm 5\lambda/2a$, etc. Minima (zero intensity) occur at $\theta = \pm\lambda/a,\ \pm 2\lambda/a$, etc. The central maximum has angular width $2\lambda/a$, which is twice that of secondary maxima ($\lambda/a$ each). Labels: Max I (first secondary maximum), Max II (second secondary maximum), Screen axis shows $-2\lambda/a,\ -\lambda/a,\ 0,\ +\lambda/a,\ +2\lambda/a$.]

**(b)** How are the intensity and angular width of the central maximum affected when:

**Solution:**
The angular width of the central maximum is:
$$\text{Angular Width} = \frac{2\lambda}{a}$$

The intensity of the central maximum is proportional to $a^2$ (the square of the slit width), and the linear width of the pattern on screen is proportional to the slit-to-screen distance $D$.

**(i) Width of slit is increased:**

When slit width $a$ **increases**:
- Angular width $= \dfrac{2\lambda}{a}$ **decreases** (central maximum becomes narrower)
- Intensity of the central maximum **increases** (more light passes through, energy concentrated in narrower central peak)

**(ii) Separation between slit and screen is decreased:**

When the slit-to-screen distance $D$ **decreases**:
- **Angular width** $= \dfrac{2\lambda}{a}$ is **unchanged** (it depends only on $\lambda$ and $a$, not on $D$)
- The **linear width** of the central maximum on the screen decreases (since linear width $= \dfrac{2\lambda D}{a}$)
- **Intensity** of the central maximum **decreases** (the same amount of light is now spread but the screen captures a smaller solid angle — effectively the irradiance at the screen changes)

### Q29.
With the help of a simple diagram, explain the working of a silicon solar cell, giving all three basic processes involved. Draw its I-V characteristics.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A silicon solar cell consisting of a thin p-type layer on top and a thick n-type layer below, forming a p-n junction. Sunlight (shown as downward arrows) strikes the top p-type surface. A front metal contact (grid electrode) is on the top p-type surface and a back metal contact covers the bottom of the n-type layer. A load resistance $R_L$ is connected externally between the two contacts, and the photocurrent $I_L$ flows through it.]

**Construction:**
A silicon solar cell typically consists of a thick n-type semiconductor layer with a thin p-type semiconductor layer on top, forming a p-n junction. Metal electrodes are placed on the p-type surface (front contact, allowing light to pass) and on the back of the n-type layer (back contact).

**Working Principle:**
When sunlight strikes the solar cell, photons penetrate into the p-n junction region. Photons with energy $\geq E_g$ (the bandgap) are absorbed and generate **electron-hole pairs** near the junction.

**Three Basic Processes:**

1. **Generation:** Absorption of photons near the junction creates electron-hole pairs (minority carriers on each side).

2. **Separation:** The built-in electric field in the depletion region separates the photo-generated carriers — electrons drift to the n-side and holes drift to the p-side.

3. **Collection:** The electrons reaching the n-side are collected by the front/back contact on the n-side, and holes reaching the p-side are collected by the front contact on the p-side, driving a current through the external load.

**I-V Characteristics:**

[Diagram: A graph with current $I$ on the y-axis and voltage $V$ on the x-axis. The curve starts in the fourth quadrant (negative current, positive voltage region), showing that the solar cell acts as a current source. Point A is the open-circuit voltage $V_{OC}$ (where $I = 0$, on the positive V-axis). Point B is the short-circuit current $I_{SC}$ (where $V = 0$, on the negative I-axis). The operating curve lies in the fourth quadrant between A and B, representing the power-generating regime of the cell.]

### Q30.
A resistance $R$ and an inductor $L$ are connected in series to a source $V = V_0 \sin\omega t$. Find:

- (a) Peak value of the voltage drops across $R$ and $L$
- (b) Phase difference between the applied voltage and current
- Which of them is ahead?

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A series RL circuit with a resistor $R$ and inductor $X_L$ connected in series, driven by an AC source $V = V_0\sin\omega t$. The peak current $I_0$ flows through the circuit.]

The impedance of the series RL circuit:
$$Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}, \quad \text{where } X_L = \omega L$$

Peak current:
$$I_0 = \frac{V_0}{Z} = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}}$$

**(a) Peak voltage drops across $R$ and $L$:**

Peak voltage across the resistor:
$$V_{R_0} = I_0 R = \frac{V_0 R}{\sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}}$$

Peak voltage across the inductor:
$$V_{L_0} = I_0 X_L = \frac{V_0 X_L}{\sqrt{R^2 + X_L^2}}$$

**(b) Phase difference and which is ahead:**

The phase difference $\phi$ between the applied voltage and the current is:

$$\tan\phi = \frac{X_L}{R} \implies \phi = \tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{X_L}{R}\right)$$

In an inductive circuit, the **voltage leads the current** (or equivalently, the current lags the voltage) by the phase angle $\phi$. The applied voltage is **ahead** of the current by angle $\phi$.

### Q31.

**(a)** Write the expression for the speed of light in a material medium of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_r$ and relative magnetic permeability $\mu_r$.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The speed of electromagnetic waves in a medium is:
$$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\varepsilon}}$$

where $\mu = \mu_r\mu_0$ and $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0$. Substituting:

$$\boxed{v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_r\mu_0\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0}}}$$

Since $c = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}$, this can also be written as $v = \dfrac{c}{\sqrt{\mu_r\varepsilon_r}}$.

**(b)** Write the wavelength range and name of the electromagnetic waves used in:

**(i) Radar systems for aircraft navigation:**

**Answer:**
**Microwaves** are used in radar systems for aircraft navigation.
Wavelength range: **1 mm to 0.1 m** (frequency range ~3 GHz to 300 GHz).

**(ii) Earth satellites to observe the growth of crops:**

**Answer:**
**Infrared (IR) waves** are used in earth satellites to observe the growth of crops (thermal imaging of vegetation).
Wavelength range: **700 nm to 1 mm**.

### Q32.

**(a)** Two cells of emf $E_1$ and $E_2$ have their internal resistances $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Deduce an expression for the equivalent emf and internal resistance of their parallel combination when connected across an external resistance $R$. Assume that the two cells are supporting each other.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Two cells (emf $E_1$, internal resistance $r_1$) and (emf $E_2$, internal resistance $r_2$) connected in parallel between terminals A and B. Total current $I$ flows out of the combination into the external circuit. Current $I_1$ flows through cell 1 and $I_2$ flows through cell 2, with $I = I_1 + I_2$.]

**Solution:**

Let $V$ be the terminal voltage (potential difference between A and B).

For cell 1:
$$V = E_1 - I_1 r_1 \implies I_1 = \frac{E_1 - V}{r_1} \quad \cdots (2)$$

For cell 2:
$$V = E_2 - I_2 r_2 \implies I_2 = \frac{E_2 - V}{r_2} \quad \cdots (3)$$

Total current $I = I_1 + I_2$:
$$I = \frac{E_1 - V}{r_1} + \frac{E_2 - V}{r_2} = \left(\frac{E_1}{r_1} + \frac{E_2}{r_2}\right) - V\left(\frac{1}{r_1} + \frac{1}{r_2}\right)$$

Solving for $V$:
$$V = \left(\frac{E_1 r_2 + E_2 r_1}{r_1 + r_2}\right) - I\left(\frac{r_1 r_2}{r_1 + r_2}\right)$$

Comparing with $V = E_{eq} - I r_{eq}$:

$$\boxed{E_{eq} = \frac{E_1 r_2 + E_2 r_1}{r_1 + r_2}}$$

$$\boxed{r_{eq} = \frac{r_1 r_2}{r_1 + r_2}}$$

**(b)** In case the cells are identical, each of $E = 5\ \text{V}$ and internal resistance $r = 2\ \Omega$, calculate the voltage across the external resistance $R = 10\ \Omega$.

**Answer:** $V_{ext} \approx 4.54\ \text{V}$

**Solution:**

Equivalent internal resistance:
$$r_{eq} = \frac{2 \times 2}{2 + 2} = 1\ \Omega$$

Equivalent emf:
$$E_{eq} = \frac{5 \times 2 + 5 \times 2}{2 + 2} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\ \text{V}$$

Current in external circuit:
$$I = \frac{E_{eq}}{R + r_{eq}} = \frac{5}{10 + 1} = \frac{5}{11}\ \text{A}$$

Voltage across external resistance:
$$V_{ext} = IR = \frac{5}{11} \times 10 = \frac{50}{11} \approx 4.54\ \text{V}$$

### Q33.

**(a)** Write an expression of the magnetic moment associated with a current ($I$) carrying circular coil of radius $r$ having $N$ turns.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The magnetic moment of a current carrying circular coil is:
$$M = NIA$$

where $A = \pi r^2$ is the area of the coil. Therefore:

$$\boxed{M = NI\pi r^2}$$

**(b)** Consider the above-mentioned coil placed in the YZ-plane. Find the magnetic field due to it at a point $(x, 0, 0)$.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A circular coil of radius $R$ and $N$ turns lying in the YZ-plane with its centre at the origin C. Point P is on the x-axis at distance $x$ from the centre. A current element $dl$ at point A on the coil is at distance $r = \sqrt{R^2 + x^2}$ from P. The magnetic field $dB$ due to $dl$ is perpendicular to both $dl$ and $\vec{r}$. Its component $dB_y$ (perpendicular to the axis) cancels with the contribution from the diametrically opposite element, while the x-component $dB_x = dB\cos\theta$ adds up.]

**Solution:**

Due to a current element $dl$ at point A on the coil, the magnetic field at P is:
$$dB = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{dl}{r^2}, \quad r^2 = X^2 + R^2$$

By symmetry, components perpendicular to the x-axis cancel. Only the x-components add:
$$dB_x = dB\cos\theta = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{dl}{X^2 + R^2} \cdot \frac{R}{\sqrt{X^2 + R^2}}$$

Integrating around the full loop ($\oint dl = 2\pi R$) and for $N$ turns:

$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{R}{(X^2 + R^2)^{3/2}} \cdot 2\pi R \cdot N$$

$$\boxed{B = \frac{\mu_0 N I R^2}{2(X^2 + R^2)^{3/2}}}$$

directed along the positive x-axis.

**OR**

**(a)** Define current sensitivity of a galvanometer. Write its expression.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
The **current sensitivity** of a galvanometer is defined as the deflection produced per unit current flowing through it:

$$S_I = \frac{\theta}{I} = \frac{NBA}{k}$$

where $N$ is the number of turns, $B$ is the magnetic field, $A$ is the area of the coil, and $k$ is the restoring torque constant per unit twist.

Its SI unit is **radians per ampere (rad A⁻¹)** or **divisions per ampere**.

**(b)** A galvanometer has resistance $G$ and shows full scale deflection for current $I_g$.

**(i)** How can it be converted into an ammeter to measure current up to $I_0$ ($I_0 > I_g$)?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
A galvanometer is converted into an ammeter by connecting a low resistance called a **shunt** $R_S$ in **parallel** with it.

The shunt resistance is determined by the condition that when total current $I_0$ flows, only $I_g$ passes through the galvanometer:

$$(I_0 - I_g) R_S = I_g G$$

$$\boxed{R_S = \frac{I_g G}{I_0 - I_g}}$$

**(ii)** What is the effective resistance of this ammeter?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
Since the shunt $R_S$ is connected in parallel with the galvanometer resistance $G$, the effective resistance of the ammeter is:

$$R_{eff} = \frac{R_S G}{R_S + G}$$

Since $R_S \ll G$, the effective resistance of the ammeter is very small (as desired).

### Q34.
The nucleus $^{235}_{92}$Y, initially at rest, decays into $^{231}_{90}$X by emitting an $\alpha$ particle:

$$^{235}_{92}\text{Y} \to\ ^{231}_{90}\text{X} +\ ^4_2\text{He} + \text{energy}$$

The binding energies per nucleon of the parent nucleus, the daughter nucleus, and the $\alpha$ particle are 7.8 MeV, 7.835 MeV and 7.07 MeV respectively. Assuming the daughter nucleus to be formed in the unexcited state and neglecting its share in the energy of the reaction, find the speed of the emitted $\alpha$ particle.

(Mass of $\alpha$ particle $= 6.68 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg}$)

**Answer:** $v = 1.57 \times 10^7\ \text{m s}^{-1}$

**Solution:**

**Q-value of the reaction** (energy released):

The total binding energy equals (binding energy per nucleon) × (number of nucleons):

$$Q = \left[BE(^{231}X) + BE(^4\text{He}) - BE(^{235}Y)\right]$$

$$Q = \left[(7.835 \times 231) + (7.07 \times 4) - (7.8 \times 235)\right]\ \text{MeV}$$

$$Q = \left[1809.885 + 28.28 - 1833\right]\ \text{MeV}$$

$$Q = 5.165\ \text{MeV} \approx 5.18\ \text{MeV}$$

Converting to joules:
$$Q = 5.18 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}\ \text{J} = 8.288 \times 10^{-13}\ \text{J}$$

**Speed of the $\alpha$ particle** (assuming it carries all the kinetic energy, as given):

$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = Q$$

$$v^2 = \frac{2Q}{m} = \frac{2 \times 5.18 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}}{6.68 \times 10^{-27}}$$

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 5.18 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}}{6.68 \times 10^{-27}}} \approx 1.57 \times 10^7\ \text{m s}^{-1}$$

### Q35.

**(a)** Derive the expression for the torque acting on the rectangular current carrying coil of a galvanometer. Why is the magnetic field made radial?

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A rectangular coil ABCD of length $l$ and breadth $b$ carrying current $I$ suspended in a uniform magnetic field $B$. The plane of the coil makes angle $\theta$ with the field direction (or the normal to the coil makes angle $\theta$ with $B$). Forces on sides AB and CD are $F = BIl$ each (equal and opposite, forming a couple). Forces on sides BC and DA are along the axis of rotation and cancel each other.]

**Solution:**

Consider a rectangular coil ABCD with:
- Length $l$ (sides AB and CD, perpendicular to $B$)
- Breadth $b$ (sides BC and DA, parallel to $B$)
- $N$ turns, current $I$, in uniform magnetic field $B$

Force on each of the sides AB and CD:
$$F = BIl$$

These forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, forming a **couple**. The perpendicular distance between the two forces (the moment arm) is $b\sin\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the angle between the plane of the coil and the magnetic field direction).

Torque for $N$ turns:
$$\tau = F \times (b\sin\theta) \times N = BIl \cdot b\sin\theta \cdot N$$

Since $lb = A$ (area of coil):
$$\boxed{\tau = NIAB\sin\theta}$$

In vector form: $\vec{\tau} = N I (\vec{A} \times \vec{B}) = \vec{M} \times \vec{B}$

**Why is the magnetic field made radial?**

In a radial magnetic field (achieved using a cylindrical soft iron core and curved pole pieces), the plane of the coil is always **parallel to $B$**, i.e., $\theta = 90°$ always, regardless of the angular position of the coil. This gives:
$$\tau = NIAB\sin 90° = NIAB = \text{constant}$$

The deflecting torque is then always proportional to the current $I$ (since $N$, $A$, $B$ are constants), making the galvanometer scale **linear and uniform**.

**(b)** An $\alpha$ particle is accelerated through a potential difference of 10 kV and moves along the x-axis. It enters a region of uniform magnetic field $B = 2 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{T}$ acting along the y-axis. Find the radius of its path.

(Mass of $\alpha$ particle $= 6.68 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg}$)

**Answer:** $r = 10\ \text{m}$

**Solution:**

Given:
- $V = 10\ \text{kV} = 10 \times 10^3\ \text{V}$
- $B = 2 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{T}$
- $m = 6.68 \times 10^{-27}\ \text{kg}$
- Charge of $\alpha$ particle: $q = 2e = 2 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C} = 3.2 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}$

The radius of circular motion in a magnetic field:
$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

Using energy conservation for acceleration through potential difference $V$:
$$qV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \implies v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}}$$

Therefore:
$$r = \frac{1}{qB}\sqrt{2mqV} = \frac{1}{B}\sqrt{\frac{2mV}{q}}$$

$$r = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-3}}\sqrt{\frac{2 \times 6.68 \times 10^{-27} \times 10 \times 10^3}{3.2 \times 10^{-19}}}$$

$$r = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-3}}\sqrt{\frac{1.336 \times 10^{-22}}{3.2 \times 10^{-19}}} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-3}}\sqrt{4.175 \times 10^{-4}}$$

$$r = \frac{2.043 \times 10^{-2}}{2 \times 10^{-3}} \approx 10\ \text{m}$$

**OR**

**(a)** With the help of a labelled diagram, explain the working of a step-up transformer. Give reasons to explain the following:

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A step-up transformer with a laminated soft iron core. Primary coil (fewer turns, $N_P$) on the left side of the core connected to AC input source $V_P$. Secondary coil (more turns, $N_S > N_P$) on the right side connected to output load, giving output voltage $V_S > V_P$. Magnetic flux $\phi$ links both coils through the iron core.]

**Working:**
A transformer works on the principle of **mutual electromagnetic induction**. When an alternating current flows in the primary coil, it produces a time-varying magnetic flux in the soft iron core. This changing flux, by Faraday's law, induces an EMF in the secondary coil.

EMF induced in primary coil:
$$E_P = -N_P \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$

EMF induced in secondary coil:
$$E_S = -N_S \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$

Taking the ratio:
$$\frac{E_S}{E_P} = \frac{N_S}{N_P} = k \quad \text{(transformation ratio)}$$

In a **step-up transformer**, $N_S > N_P$, so $V_S > V_P$ (output voltage is higher than input voltage). By conservation of energy (ideal transformer): $V_P I_P = V_S I_S$, so the output current is correspondingly reduced.

**(i) The core of the transformer is laminated:**

**Solution:**
The iron core is laminated (made of thin insulated sheets) to **reduce eddy currents**. Eddy currents are induced circulating currents in the core due to the changing magnetic flux. Lamination greatly reduces the cross-sectional area available for eddy current paths, minimising $I^2R$ power losses as heat in the core.

**(ii) Thick copper wire is used in windings:**

**Solution:**
Thick copper wire is used to **reduce the resistance** of the windings ($R = \rho l / A$; larger cross-section $A$ means smaller $R$). This minimises the $I^2R$ (copper/ohmic) losses due to the current flowing through the windings, thereby increasing the efficiency of the transformer.

**(b)** A conducting rod PQ of length 20 cm and resistance $0.1\ \Omega$ rests on two smooth parallel rails of negligible resistance AA' and CC'. It can slide on the rails and the arrangement is positioned between the poles of a permanent magnet producing uniform magnetic field $B = 0.4\ \text{T}$. The rails, the rod, and the magnetic field are in three mutually perpendicular directions as shown in the figure. If the ends A and C of the rails are short-circuited, find:

[Diagram: A pair of horizontal parallel rails AA' and CC' separated by the rod PQ of length $l = 0.2\ \text{m}$. The rod can slide along the rails. A uniform magnetic field $B = 0.4\ \text{T}$ is directed perpendicular to the plane of the rails (into the page). The ends A and C are short-circuited, forming a closed loop of resistance $R = 0.1\ \Omega$ (the rod's resistance, rails have negligible resistance). The rod moves with velocity $v$ along the rails.]

**(i) External force required to move the rod with uniform velocity $v = 10\ \text{cm/s}$:**

**Answer:** $F = 6.4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{N}$

**Solution:**

EMF induced: $\varepsilon = Blv$

Current: $I = \dfrac{\varepsilon}{R} = \dfrac{Blv}{R}$

Force required to maintain uniform velocity (equal to the opposing magnetic braking force):

$$F = BIl = B \cdot \frac{Blv}{R} \cdot l = \frac{B^2 l^2 v}{R}$$

$$F = \frac{(0.4)^2 \times (0.2)^2 \times 0.1}{0.1} = \frac{0.16 \times 0.04 \times 0.1}{0.1} = 6.4 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{N}$$

**(ii) Power required to do so:**

**Answer:** $P = 6.4 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}$

**Solution:**

$$P = Fv = 6.4 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.1 = 6.4 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{W}$$

(This equals the electrical power dissipated in the rod: $P = \varepsilon I = \varepsilon^2/R = B^2l^2v^2/R$, confirming energy conservation.)

### Q36.

**(a)** Draw the ray diagram of an astronomical telescope when the final image is formed at infinity. Write the expression for the resolving power of the telescope.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: An astronomical telescope in normal adjustment (image at infinity). A large objective lens O on the left forms a real, inverted, diminished image of a distant object at its focal point $F_O$. This image lies at the focal point $F_e$ of the eyepiece lens E on the right. Parallel rays from the distant object enter the objective, converge at $F_O$ (= $F_e$), and emerge as parallel rays from the eyepiece (indicating final image at infinity). The distance between the lenses is $f_O + f_e$ (the length of the telescope in normal adjustment). Labels: Objective O, Eyepiece E, focal length $f_O$, focal length $f_e$, EYE at right.]

**Resolving Power of a Telescope:**
$$\text{Resolving Power} = \frac{D}{1.22\lambda}$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the objective aperture and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light used. A larger objective diameter or shorter wavelength gives higher resolving power.

**(b)** An astronomical telescope has an objective lens of focal length 20 m and an eyepiece of focal length 1 cm.

**(i)** Find the angular magnification of the telescope.

**Answer:** $m = 2000$

**Solution:**

Angular magnification of an astronomical telescope in normal adjustment:
$$m = \frac{f_O}{f_e} = \frac{20\ \text{m}}{0.01\ \text{m}} = 2000$$

**(ii)** If this telescope is used to view the Moon, find the diameter of the image formed by the objective lens.

Given: diameter of the Moon $D = 3.5 \times 10^6\ \text{m}$, radius of lunar orbit $R_{orbit} = 3.8 \times 10^8\ \text{m}$.

**Answer:** $d \approx 18.4\ \text{cm}$

**Solution:**

The angle subtended by the Moon at the objective:
$$\alpha = \frac{D}{R_{orbit}} = \frac{3.5 \times 10^6}{3.8 \times 10^8}\ \text{rad}$$

The diameter of the image formed at the focal plane of the objective:
$$d = f_O \cdot \alpha = \frac{D \cdot f_O}{R_{orbit}}$$

$$d = \frac{3.5 \times 10^6 \times 20}{3.8 \times 10^8} = \frac{7 \times 10^7}{3.8 \times 10^8} \approx 0.184\ \text{m} = 18.4\ \text{cm}$$

**OR**

**(a)** An object is placed in front of a concave mirror and it is observed that a virtual image is formed. Draw the ray diagram to show the image formation and hence derive the mirror equation.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A concave mirror with pole P, focus F (between P
