### Q1.
What is the function of a band pass filter used in a modulator for obtaining AM signal?

**Solution:**
The output produced by the square law device is passed to a band pass filter which rejects the DC and the sinusoids of frequencies $\omega_m$, $2\omega_m$ and $2\omega_c$, and retains the frequencies $\omega_c$, $\omega_c - \omega_m$ and $\omega_c + \omega_m$. The output of the band pass filter is an AM wave.

### Q2.
A planar loop of rectangular shape is moved within the region of a uniform magnetic field acting perpendicular to its plane. What is the direction and magnitude of the current induced in it?

**Solution:**
The magnetic flux linked with the circuit is not changing with time, so there will be **no induced current** in the loop. (Magnitude = 0; direction = not applicable.)

---

### Q3.
When light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium, why does the critical angle of incidence depend on the colour of light?

**Solution:**
The critical angle for a given pair of media is given by:

$$\sin i_c = \frac{1}{\mu}$$

where $\mu$ is the refractive index of the denser medium. The refractive index of a medium depends on wavelength by the Cauchy relation:

$$\mu = A + \frac{B}{\lambda^2}$$

Since each colour of light is associated with a specific wavelength, as the wavelength of light increases the refractive index decreases and hence the critical angle increases. Thus, the critical angle depends on the colour (wavelength) of light.

### Q4.
V–I graph for a metallic wire at two different temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ is as shown in the figure. Which of the two temperatures is higher and why?

[Diagram: V–I graph showing two straight lines through the origin. Line $T_1$ has a steeper slope (larger $\theta_1$) and line $T_2$ has a smaller slope (smaller $\theta_2$), with voltage $V$ on the y-axis and current $I$ on the x-axis.]

**Solution:**
The slope of a V–I graph gives the resistance of the metallic wire:

$$R = \frac{V}{I} = \tan\theta$$

The slope is higher for temperature $T_1$, meaning $R_{T_1} > R_{T_2}$. Since the resistance of a metallic wire **increases** with increasing temperature, $T_1$ is the higher temperature.

---

### Q5.
Define dielectric constant of a medium. What is its S.I. unit?

**Solution:**
The **dielectric constant** (or relative permittivity) of a dielectric is the ratio of the absolute permittivity of the medium to the absolute permittivity of free space:

$$K = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0}$$

It is a **dimensionless (unitless)** quantity — it has no S.I. unit.

### Q6.
Define a wave front. Using Huygens' principle, draw the shape of a refracted wave front when a plane wave is incident on a convex lens.

**OR**

(a) When a wave is propagating from a rarer to a denser medium, which characteristic of the wave does not change and why?

(b) What is the ratio of the velocity of the wave in the two media of refractive indices $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$?

**Solution (Main):**

**Wave front:** The locus of points which oscillate in phase is called a wave front. Thus, a wave front is defined as a surface of constant phase.

[Diagram: A plane wave (horizontal parallel rays) is incident from the left on a thin convex lens. After passing through the lens, the emerging wave front is spherical and converges to the focal point F on the right. The spherical wavefront of radius $f$ is shown converging toward point F.]

In the given figure, we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens. The emerging wave front is spherical and converges to the point F, which is known as the focus.

---

**OR**

**(a)** The **frequency** of a wave does not change when the wave propagates from a rarer to a denser medium, because frequency $\nu$ is given by the relation:

$$\nu = \frac{v}{\lambda}$$

As the medium changes, both velocity $v$ and wavelength $\lambda$ change such that their ratio remains constant. Frequency depends on the source, not the medium.

**(b)** The ratio of the velocity of the wave in medium 1 to that in medium 2 is:

$$\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}$$

where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the velocities of the wave in medium 1 and medium 2, and $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are their respective refractive indices.

### Q7.
A variable resistor $R$ is connected across a cell of emf $\varepsilon$ and internal resistance $r$ as shown in the figure. Draw a plot showing the variation of (i) terminal voltage $V$ and (ii) the current $I$, as a function of $R$.

[Diagram: Circuit diagram showing a variable resistor $R$ (rheostat symbol) connected in series with a battery of emf $\varepsilon$ and internal resistance $r$. Current $I$ flows out of the positive terminal, through $R$, and returns to the negative terminal.]

**Solution:**

**(i) Terminal voltage $V$ as a function of $R$:**

As resistance $R$ increases, current $I$ in the circuit decreases and terminal voltage $V$ increases. We know:

$$V = \varepsilon - Ir$$

[Diagram: Graph of $V$ (volts) on the y-axis versus $R$ ($\Omega$) on the x-axis. The curve starts from a low positive value at $R = 0$ and increases, approaching $\varepsilon$ asymptotically as $R \to \infty$. The shape is a concave increasing curve.]

**(ii) Current $I$ as a function of $R$:**

The current in the circuit is given by:

$$I = \frac{\varepsilon}{R + r}$$

When $R$ increases, $I$ decreases.

[Diagram: Graph of $I$ (A) on the y-axis versus $R$ ($\Omega$) on the x-axis. The curve starts at $I = \varepsilon/r$ when $R = 0$ and decreases hyperbolically, approaching zero as $R \to \infty$.]

### Q8.
Differentiate between amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) waves by drawing suitable diagrams. Why is FM signal preferred over AM signal?

**Solution:**

- **Amplitude Modulation (AM):** When the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed in accordance with the intensity of the signal, it is called amplitude modulation.

- **Frequency Modulation (FM):** When the frequency of the carrier wave is changed in accordance with the intensity of the signal, it is called frequency modulation.

[Diagram: Four waveforms stacked vertically:
- (a) Sinusoidal carrier wave $c(t)$: constant amplitude and frequency
- (b) Modulating signal $m(t)$: low-frequency sinusoidal wave
- (c) AM wave $c_m(t)$ for AM: carrier with amplitude varying according to $m(t)$
- (d) FM wave $c_m(t)$ for FM: carrier with frequency varying according to $m(t)$, amplitude constant]

**FM signal is preferred over AM signal because:**

1. Various electrical machines and external noise sources cause amplitude disturbances in the transmission of amplitude modulated waves, making reception noisy. Frequency modulation can reduce this noise factor since noise primarily affects amplitude.

2. The fidelity (audio quality) of amplitude modulated transmission is poor and is not suitable for musical programmes. In FM, the amplitude of the carrier is kept constant; amplitude-sensitive noise is eliminated, resulting in higher quality audio.

### Q9.
Determine the distance of closest approach when an alpha particle of kinetic energy 4.5 MeV strikes a nucleus of $Z = 80$, stops and reverses its direction.

**Solution:**

At the distance of nearest approach, all kinetic energy is converted to electrostatic potential energy:

$$PE = KE$$

$$\frac{k(ze)(2e)}{r_0} = 4.5 \ MeV = 4.5 \times 10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ J$$

Solving for $r_0$:

$$r_0 = \frac{k(ze)(2e)}{4.5 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}}$$

$$r_0 = \frac{9 \times 10^9 \times 80 \times 2 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2}{4.5 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}}$$

$$\boxed{r_0 = 51.2 \times 10^{-15} \ m}$$

### Q10.
When the electron orbiting in a hydrogen atom in its ground state moves to the third excited state, show how the de Broglie wavelength associated with it would be affected.

**Solution:**

The velocity of an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by:

$$v_n = \frac{e^2}{2n\varepsilon_0 h} \implies v_n \propto \frac{1}{n} \quad \cdots (i)$$

The de Broglie wavelength associated with it is:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv}$$

So:

$$\lambda \propto \frac{1}{v_n} \quad \cdots (ii)$$

Using equations (i) and (ii):

$$\lambda \propto n$$

When the electron jumps from ground state $n_1 = 1$ to the third excited state $n_2 = 4$:

$$\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{1}{4}$$

$$\therefore \lambda_2 = 4\lambda_1$$

**The de Broglie wavelength increases four times.**

### Q11.
In Young's double slit experiment, the two slits are separated by a distance of 1.5 mm and the screen is placed 1 m away from the plane of the slits. A beam of light consisting of two wavelengths 650 nm and 520 nm is used to obtain interference fringes. Find:

(a) The distance of the third bright fringe for $\lambda = 520$ nm on the screen from the central maximum.

(b) The least distance from the central maximum where the bright fringes due to both the wavelengths coincide.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- $d = 1.5 \ mm = 1.5 \times 10^{-3} \ m$
- $D = 1 \ m$
- $\lambda_1 = 520 \ nm = 520 \times 10^{-9} \ m$
- $\lambda_2 = 650 \ nm = 650 \times 10^{-9} \ m$

**(a)** The position of the $n$-th bright fringe is $x_n = \dfrac{n\lambda D}{d}$.

Third bright fringe for $\lambda_1 = 520$ nm:

$$x_3 = \frac{3\lambda_1 D}{d} = \frac{3 \times 520 \times 10^{-9} \times 1}{1.5 \times 10^{-3}}$$

$$\boxed{x_3 = 1.04 \times 10^{-3} \ m = 1.04 \ mm}$$

**(b)** Let $n_1$-th bright band of $\lambda_1 = 520$ nm coincide with $n_2$-th bright band of $\lambda_2 = 650$ nm:

$$\frac{n_1 \lambda_1 D}{d} = \frac{n_2 \lambda_2 D}{d} \implies n_1 \lambda_1 = n_2 \lambda_2$$

$$\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \frac{650}{520} = \frac{5}{4}$$

So the minimum integers are $n_1 = 5$ and $n_2 = 4$.

The least distance from the central maximum:

$$x = \frac{n_1 \lambda_1 D}{d} = \frac{5 \times 520 \times 10^{-9} \times 1}{1.5 \times 10^{-3}}$$

$$\boxed{x = 1.73 \times 10^{-3} \ m = 1.73 \ mm}$$

### Q12.
(a) The figure shows the plot of binding energy (BE) per nucleon as a function of mass number A. The letters A, B, C, D and E represent the positions of typical nuclei on the curve. Point out, giving reasons, the two processes (in terms of A, B, C, D and E), one of which can occur due to nuclear fission and the other due to nuclear fusion.

[Diagram: A graph of BE/A (y-axis) versus Mass number A (x-axis). The curve rises steeply for small A, reaches a broad maximum around C and D (near $A \approx 56$–$120$), and then gradually decreases for large A. Points A and B are on the rising left portion (small mass numbers), C and D are near the peak, and E is on the descending right portion (large mass number).]

(b) Identify the nature of the radioactive radiations emitted in each step of the decay process given below:

$${}^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow {}^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y \rightarrow {}^{A-4}_{Z-1}W$$

**Solution:**

**(a)**
- **Nuclear Fusion:** The nuclei at positions **A and B** undergo nuclear fusion. Their binding energy per nucleon is small, making them less stable. They fuse with other nuclei to form a more stable (higher BE/A) nucleus, releasing energy.

- **Nuclear Fission:** The nucleus at position **E** undergoes nuclear fission. Its binding energy per nucleon is less than that of the intermediate nuclei (C, D). It splits into two or more lighter nuclei with higher BE/A, thereby becoming more stable and releasing energy.

**(b)**

$${}^{A}_{Z}X \xrightarrow{} {}^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y \xrightarrow{} {}^{A-4}_{Z-1}W$$

- **First step** ($X \to Y$): The atomic mass decreases by 4 and the atomic number decreases by 2. This corresponds to the emission of an **alpha particle** $\left({}^{4}_{2}He\right)$.

- **Second step** ($Y \to W$): The atomic mass remains the same ($A-4$) but the atomic number increases by 1. This corresponds to the emission of an **electron (beta-minus particle)** $\left({}^{0}_{-1}e\right)$.

### Q13.
Name the three different modes of propagation in a communication system. State briefly why electromagnetic waves with frequency range from a few MHz up to 30 MHz can reflect back to the earth. What happens when the frequency range exceeds this limit?

**Solution:**

**The three different modes of propagation in a communication system are:**

1. **Ground wave**
2. **Sky wave**
3. **Space wave**

**Why EM waves (few MHz to 30 MHz) reflect back to Earth:**

In the frequency range from a few MHz up to 30–40 MHz, long-distance communication is achieved by **ionospheric reflection** of radio waves back towards the earth. This mode is called **sky wave propagation**.

The **ionosphere** (extending from ~65 km to ~400 km above the earth's surface) contains a large number of ions and free electrons produced by absorption of ultraviolet and other high-energy solar radiation. The degree of ionisation varies with height, creating layers of varying electron density. The ionospheric layer acts as a **reflector** for frequencies in the range of 3 to 30 MHz, bending the EM waves back toward the earth in a manner analogous to total internal reflection in optics.

**When frequency exceeds 30 MHz:**

Electromagnetic waves of frequencies **higher than 30 MHz penetrate the ionosphere** and escape into outer space. They are not reflected back to earth, so ionospheric (sky wave) propagation is not possible beyond this limit. Communication at such frequencies uses space waves or satellite links.

### Q14.
Define the terms "stopping potential" and "threshold frequency" in relation to the photoelectric effect. How does one determine these physical quantities using Einstein's equation?

**Solution:**

**Stopping Potential ($V_0$):** For a particular frequency of incident radiation, the minimum negative (retarding) potential given to the anode plate for which the photocurrent stops or becomes zero is called the **cut-off** or **stopping potential**.

**Threshold Frequency ($\nu_0$):** There exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency $\nu_0$ for which the stopping potential is zero. Below $\nu_0$, electron emission is not possible. This cut-off frequency is known as the **threshold frequency**, and it is different for different metals.

**Einstein's Photoelectric Equation:**

In the photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy $h\nu$ of radiation. If this energy exceeds the minimum energy required for the electron to escape the metal surface, the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is:

$$K = h\nu - \varphi$$

The **maximum kinetic energy** of photoelectrons is:

$$K_{max} = h\nu - \varphi_0 \quad \cdots (2)$$

where $\varphi_0$ is the work function (least value of $\varphi$). This is **Einstein's photoelectric equation**.

**Determination of physical quantities:**

**(i)** Since $K_{max} = eV_0$, equation (2) gives:

$$eV_0 = h\nu - \varphi_0$$

A graph of $V_0$ versus $\nu$ is a straight line with slope $h/e$. The stopping potential $V_0$ is found by measuring the retarding potential at which photocurrent becomes zero for each frequency.

**(ii)** Since $K_{max}$ must be non-negative:

$$h\nu \geq \varphi_0 \implies \nu \geq \nu_0 = \frac{\varphi_0}{h}$$

The threshold frequency is the x-intercept of the $V_0$ vs $\nu$ graph (where $V_0 = 0$):

$$\nu_0 = \frac{\varphi_0}{h}$$

Below $\nu_0$, no photoelectric emission occurs regardless of intensity.

**(iii)** Since intensity is proportional to the number of photons per unit area per unit time, greater intensity means more electrons absorbing energy, leading to greater photocurrent (for $\nu > \nu_0$), but $K_{max}$ remains independent of intensity.

### Q15.
Three circuits, each consisting of a switch 'S' and two capacitors, are initially charged as shown in the figure. After the switch has been closed, in which circuit will the charge on the left-hand capacitor (i) increase, (ii) decrease, and (iii) remain the same? Give reasons.

[Diagram: Three circuits side by side:
- Circuit (a): Switch S in series; left capacitor $2C$ with charge $6Q$; right capacitor $C$ with charge $3Q$. Both capacitors have their positive plates facing each other.
- Circuit (b): Switch S in series; left capacitor $C$ with charge $6Q$; right capacitor $C$ with charge $3Q$. Positive plates face each other.
- Circuit (c): Switch S in series; left capacitor $3C$ with charge $6Q$; right capacitor $C$ with charge $3Q$. Positive plates facing each other.]

**Solution:**

When charged capacitors are connected to each other, charge flows from the capacitor at higher potential toward the capacitor at lower potential until a common potential is reached.

The potential across each capacitor:

| Circuit | Left Capacitor | Right Capacitor |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| (a) | $V_L = \dfrac{6Q}{2C} = \dfrac{3Q}{C}$ | $V_R = \dfrac{3Q}{C}$ |
| (b) | $V_L = \dfrac{6Q}{C}$ | $V_R = \dfrac{3Q}{C}$ |
| (c) | $V_L = \dfrac{6Q}{3C} = \dfrac{2Q}{C}$ | $V_R = \dfrac{3Q}{C}$ |

**(a)** In circuit (a): Both capacitors are at the **same potential** $\left(\dfrac{3Q}{C}\right)$. No charge flows. The charge on the left-hand capacitor **remains the same**.

**(b)** In circuit (b): The potential of the **left-hand** capacitor ($6Q/C$) is **higher** than the right ($3Q/C$). Charge flows from left to right. The charge on the left-hand capacitor **decreases**.

**(c)** In circuit (c): The potential of the **left-hand** capacitor ($2Q/C$) is **lower** than the right ($3Q/C$). Charge flows from right to left. The charge on the left-hand capacitor **increases**.

### Q16.
The outputs of two NOT gates are fed to a NOR gate. Draw the logic circuit of the combination of gates. Write its truth table. Identify the gate equivalent to this circuit.

**OR**

You are given circuits (a) and (b) as shown in the figures, which consist of NAND gates. Identify the logic operation carried out by the two. Write the truth tables for each. Identify the gates equivalent to the two circuits.

[Diagram (a): Two inputs A and B each fed into a separate NAND gate; the outputs $Y_1$ of both NAND gates are fed together into a second NAND gate to produce output Y.]

[Diagram (b): Input A fed into a NAND gate with both inputs tied together (giving $\overline{A}$); Input B fed into a NAND gate with both inputs tied together (giving $\overline{B}$); the outputs $\overline{A}$ and $\overline{B}$ are fed into a third NAND gate to produce output Y.]

**Solution (Main — NOT + NOR combination):**

[Diagram: Two inputs A and B are each passed through NOT gates to give $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$ respectively. These two outputs are then fed as inputs to a NOR gate to produce the final output $Y$.]

$$Y_1 = \bar{A}, \quad Y_2 = \bar{B}$$

$$Y = \overline{Y_1 + Y_2} = \overline{\bar{A} + \bar{B}} = \overline{\bar{A}} \cdot \overline{\bar{B}} = A \cdot B$$

The equivalent gate is an **AND gate**.

**Truth Table:**

| A | B | $Y_1 = \bar{A}$ | $Y_2 = \bar{B}$ | $Y = A \cdot B$ |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

---

**OR**

**(a) Circuit with NAND–NAND:**

$$Y_1 = \overline{A \cdot B}$$

$$Y = \overline{Y_1 \cdot Y_1} = \overline{(\overline{AB}) \cdot (\overline{AB})} = \overline{\overline{AB}} = AB$$

The equivalent gate is an **AND gate**.

**Truth Table:**

| A | B | $Y_1 = \overline{AB}$ | $Y = AB$ |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

---

**(b) Circuit — two single-input NAND gates feeding one NAND gate:**

$$Y_1 = \overline{A \cdot A} = \bar{A}$$

$$Y_2 = \overline{B \cdot B} = \bar{B}$$

$$Y = \overline{Y_1 \cdot Y_2} = \overline{\bar{A} \cdot \bar{B}} = \overline{\bar{A}} + \overline{\bar{B}} = A + B$$

The equivalent gate is an **OR gate**.

**Truth Table:**

| A | B | $Y_1 = \bar{A}$ | $Y_2 = \bar{B}$ | $Y = A + B$ |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

### Q17.
With the help of a circuit diagram, explain the working of a junction diode as a full wave rectifier. Draw its input and output waveforms. Which characteristic property makes the junction diode suitable for rectification?

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Full-wave rectifier circuit consisting of a centre-tap transformer with primary coil connected to AC supply. The secondary has a centre tap (midpoint). The two ends of the secondary are connected to the p-side of diodes D₁ (at point A) and D₂ (at point B) respectively. The n-sides of both diodes are connected together at point X. The output load resistor $R_L$ is connected between X and the centre tap Y. Three waveforms are shown to the right: (i) waveform at A — full sinusoid; (ii) waveform at B — full sinusoid, phase-shifted by 180°; (iii) output waveform across $R_L$ — full-wave rectified (all positive humps), alternately due to D₁ and D₂.]

The circuit using two diodes gives output rectified voltage corresponding to **both the positive and negative half** of the AC cycle — hence it is called a **full-wave rectifier**.

- The p-sides of D₁ and D₂ are connected to the ends A and B of the secondary.
- The n-sides are connected together; output is taken between this common point and the centre tap.
- The secondary of the transformer has a **centre tap** (centre-tap transformer).

**Working:**

- **Positive half cycle:** Voltage at A is positive, voltage at B is negative. D₁ is forward biased (conducts); D₂ is reverse biased (does not conduct). Current flows through $R_L$ in direction X→Y.

- **Negative half cycle:** Voltage at A is negative, voltage at B is positive. D₂ is forward biased (conducts); D₁ is reverse biased. Current flows through $R_L$ in the same direction X→Y.

Thus, output voltage appears across $R_L$ during **both** half cycles.

**Characteristic property that makes a diode suitable for rectification:**

A p-n junction diode is a **unidirectional device** — it offers negligible resistance when forward biased (conducts) and very high resistance when reverse biased (does not conduct). This unidirectional conduction property makes it suitable for rectification.

### Q18.
A potential difference $V$ is applied across a conductor of length $L$ and diameter $D$. How is the drift velocity, $v_d$, of charge carriers in the conductor affected when (i) $V$ is halved, (ii) $L$ is doubled, and (iii) $D$ is halved? Justify your answer in each case.

**Solution:**

Drift velocity is given by:

$$|v_d| = \frac{e\tau}{m} E$$

Also, the electric field $E = \dfrac{V}{L}$, so:

$$|v_d| = \frac{e\tau}{m} \cdot \frac{V}{L}$$

Thus $v_d \propto \dfrac{V}{L}$, and $v_d$ is **independent of the diameter** $D$.

**(i) When $V$ is halved ($V \to V/2$):**

$$v_d' = \frac{e\tau}{m} \cdot \frac{V/2}{L} = \frac{v_d}{2}$$

Drift velocity is **halved**.

**(ii) When $L$ is doubled ($L \to 2L$):**

$$v_d' = \frac{e\tau}{m} \cdot \frac{V}{2L} = \frac{v_d}{2}$$

Drift velocity is **halved**.

**(iii) When $D$ is halved ($D \to D/2$):**

Since $v_d = \dfrac{e\tau V}{mL}$ does not depend on the cross-sectional area or diameter, drift velocity **remains the same**.

### Q19.
A cyclotron's oscillator frequency is 10 MHz. What should be the operating magnetic field for accelerating protons? If the radius of its 'dees' is 60 cm, calculate the kinetic energy (in MeV) of the proton beam produced by the accelerator.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Frequency: $\nu = 10 \ MHz = 10^7 \ Hz$
- Mass of proton: $m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \ kg$
- Charge of proton: $q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \ C$
- Radius of dees: $r = 60 \ cm = 0.6 \ m$

**Operating magnetic field:**

The cyclotron frequency condition gives:

$$B = \frac{2\pi m \nu}{q} = \frac{2 \times 3.14 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \times 10^7}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}$$

$$\boxed{B = 0.65 \ T}$$

**Kinetic energy of the proton beam:**

$$KE = \frac{q^2 B^2 r^2}{2m} = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 \times (0.65)^2 \times (0.6)^2}{2 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}$$

$$KE = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 \times (0.65)^2 \times (0.6)^2}{2 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-13}} \ MeV$$

$$\boxed{KE \approx 7 \ MeV}$$

### Q20.
Deduce the expression for the torque $\vec{\tau}$ acting on a planar loop of area $\vec{A}$ and carrying current $I$ placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$. If the loop is free to rotate, what would be its orientation in stable equilibrium?

**Solution:**

[Diagram (a): A rectangular current loop ABCD placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ directed horizontally. The area vector $\vec{m}$ makes an arbitrary angle $\theta$ with $\vec{B}$. Forces $F_1$ and $F_2$ act on the sides AB and CD respectively.
Diagram (b): Top (end-on) view of the loop showing the two forces $\vec{F_1}$ (downward) and $\vec{F_2}$ (upward) acting on the arms AB and CD, separated by a perpendicular distance $a\sin\theta$, constituting a couple.]

Consider a rectangular loop ABCD of sides $a$ and $b$, carrying current $I$, placed in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The plane of the loop makes angle $\theta$ with $\vec{B}$ (i.e., the normal to the loop makes angle $\theta$ with $\vec{B}$).

- Forces on arms BC and DA are **equal, opposite, and collinear** along the axis — they cancel, producing no net torque.
- Forces on arms AB and CD:

$$F_1 = F_2 = IbB$$

These forces are **equal and opposite but not collinear** — they form a couple.

The magnitude of the torque:

$$\tau = F_1 \cdot \frac{a}{2}\sin\theta + F_2 \cdot \frac{a}{2}\sin\theta = IbB \cdot a\sin\theta$$

$$\tau = IAB\sin\theta \quad \cdots (i)$$

where $A = ab$ is the area of the loop.

Defining the **magnetic moment** of the current loop as $\vec{m} = I\vec{A}$, this can be written in vector form as:

$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{m} \times \vec{B}$$

**Stable Equilibrium:**

The torque $\tau$ vanishes when $\vec{m}$ is **parallel** to $\vec{B}$ (i.e., $\theta = 0°$). When $\vec{m}$ and $\vec{B}$ are parallel, the equilibrium is **stable**. (When antiparallel, $\theta = 180°$, the equilibrium is unstable.)

### Q21.
How are electromagnetic waves produced? What is the source of the energy carried by a propagating electromagnetic wave? Identify the electromagnetic radiations used:
(i) In remote switches of household electronic devices; and
(ii) As a diagnostic tool in medicine.

**Solution:**

**Production of electromagnetic waves:**

According to Maxwell's theory, **accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves**. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency (an oscillating charge is an example of an accelerating charge). This produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn produces an oscillating electric field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields regenerate each other as the wave propagates through space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave equals the frequency of oscillation of the charge.

**Source of energy:**

The energy associated with the propagating wave comes **at the expense of the energy of the source** — i.e., the energy of the accelerated charge.

**Identification of electromagnetic radiations:**

(i) **Remote switches of household electronic devices:** **Infrared rays**

(ii) **Diagnostic tool in medicine:** **X-rays**

### Q22.
(a) A ray of light is incident normally on the face AB of a right-angled glass prism of refractive index $_{a}\mu_g = 1.5$. The prism is partly immersed in a liquid of unknown refractive index. Find the value of the refractive index of the liquid so that the ray grazes along the face BC after refraction through the prism.

(b) Trace the path of the rays if it were incident normally on the face AC.

[Diagram: A right-angled prism with the right angle at C. Face AB is the hypotenuse (top), face AC is vertical (left), and face BC is horizontal (bottom). The prism is partially immersed in liquid (shown by hatching below face BC). A ray enters normally through face AB, travels inside the prism, and hits face BC at angle of incidence $i = 60°$. The ray then grazes along face BC (emerges at 90° to the normal of BC).]

**Solution:**

**(a)**

The ray enters face AB normally, so it travels without bending inside the prism. It hits face BC at an angle of incidence $i = 60°$ (from the geometry of the right-angled prism with the angle at A being 60°).

For the ray to graze along face BC, the angle of incidence must equal the critical angle for the glass–liquid interface:

$$\sin i_c = \frac{\mu_\ell}{\mu_g}$$

$$\mu_\ell = \mu_g \sin i = 1.5 \times \sin 60°$$

$$\mu_\ell = 1.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1.5 \times 0.866$$

$$\boxed{\mu_\ell \approx 1.3}$$

**(b)**

[Diagram: The same prism with a ray entering normally through face AC. Inside the prism the ray travels horizontally and hits face BC at an angle of incidence of 30°. Two scenarios are shown: Ray 1 (glass–air interface) and Ray 2 (glass–liquid interface).]

The angle of incidence for rays on face BC when entering through face AC is **30°**.

**For Ray 1 (glass–air interface):**

$$\sin i_c = \frac{\mu_a}{\mu_g} = \frac{1}{1.5} = 0.66 \implies i_c = 41°$$

Since the angle of incidence (30°) $<$ critical angle (41°), **refraction takes place** and the ray passes through face BC into air.

**For Ray 2 (glass–liquid interface, $\mu_\ell = 1.3$):**

$$\sin i_c = \frac{\mu_\ell}{\mu_g} = \frac{1.3}{1.5} = 0.866 \implies i_c = 60°$$

Since the angle of incidence (30°) $<$ critical angle (60°), **refraction takes place** and the ray passes through face BC into the liquid.

## Section D — Value Based Question (4 Marks)

### Q23.
Sunita and her friends visited an exhibition. The policeman asked them to pass through a metal detector. Sunita's friends were initially scared of it. Sunita, however, explained to them the purpose and working of the metal detector.

Answer the following questions:

(a) On what principle does a metal detector work?

(b) Why does the detector emit sound when a person carrying any metallic object walks through it?

(c) State any two qualities which Sunita displayed while explaining the purpose of walking through the detector.

**Solution:**

**(a)** The metal detector works on the principle of **resonance in an AC circuit**.

**(b)** When a person passes through a metal detector, they pass through a coil of many turns connected to a capacitor. The LC circuit is tuned to resonance. When a metallic object is brought into the coil, the **inductance** of the coil changes, which changes the **impedance** of the circuit. This results in a significant change in the current in the circuit. This change in current is detected by the electric circuitry, which causes a **sound (alarm) to be emitted**.

**(c)** Two qualities Sunita displayed:
1. **Curiosity / Scientific temperament** — she understood the working of the detector.
2. **Helpfulness / Power of observation** — she calmed her friends by rationally explaining the purpose and working of the device.

### Q24.
(a) State Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.

(b) Explain, with the help of a suitable example, how we can show that Lenz's law is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy.

(c) Use the expression for Lorentz force acting on the charge carriers of a conductor to obtain the expression for the induced emf across the conductor of length $\ell$ moving with velocity $v$ through a magnetic field $B$ acting perpendicular to its length.

**OR**

(a) Using phasor diagram, derive the expression for the current flowing in an ideal inductor connected to an AC source of voltage $v = v_0 \sin\omega t$. Hence plot graphs showing variation of (i) applied voltage and (ii) the current as a function of $\omega t$.

(b) Derive an expression for the average power dissipated in a series LCR circuit.

---

**Solution (Main):**

**(a) Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:**

**(i)** Whenever there is a change of magnetic flux through a circuit, there will be an induced emf, and this will last as long as the change persists.

**(ii)** The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. Mathematically:

$$\varepsilon = -\frac{d\phi_B}{dt}$$

**(b) Lenz's Law as a consequence of conservation of energy:**

[Diagram: (a) A bar magnet with its N-pole approaching a conducting coil. By Lenz's law, the induced current creates a North pole facing the approaching magnet (repulsion), so the induced current flows counterclockwise (when viewed from the magnet side). (b) The same setup but if the induced current were reversed, the South pole of the coil would face the N-pole of the magnet (attraction).]

Suppose the induced current were in the **direction opposite** to that given by Lenz's law. In that case, the south pole of the coil would face the approaching north pole of the magnet — the magnet would be **attracted** with ever-increasing acceleration. A gentle push would initiate the process, and the magnet's velocity and kinetic energy would continuously increase without any energy expenditure — a **perpetual motion machine**. This violates the **law of conservation of energy**.

In the **correct** case (Lenz's law): the north face of the coil repels the approaching north pole of the magnet. A person must do **work** to move the magnet against this repulsive force. This work is dissipated as **Joule heating** by the induced current. Energy is conserved. Hence Lenz's law is a consequence of the conservation of energy.

**(c) Motional EMF using Lorentz force:**

[Diagram: Rectangular conductor PQRS lying in the plane of the paper in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ directed into the page (shown by ×). The arm PQ (of length $\ell$) is free to move and is moved to the left with constant velocity $v$. The other arms QR, RS, SP are fixed rails. x is the length RQ and the area of the loop changes as PQ moves.]

Consider a straight conductor PQ of length $\ell$ moving with velocity $v$ perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field $B$ (directed into the page). The magnetic flux enclosed by the loop PQRS:

$$\phi_B = B \ell x$$

The rate of change of flux gives the induced emf:

$$\varepsilon = -\frac{d\phi_B}{dt} = -\frac{d(B\ell x)}{dt} = -B\ell \frac{dx}{dt} = B\ell v$$

(where $dx/dt = -v$, the speed of conductor PQ, and the magnitude of emf is $B\ell v$).

**Using Lorentz force:**

Consider an arbitrary charge $q$ in the conductor PQ. When the rod moves with speed $v$, the charge also moves with speed $v$ in magnetic field $B$. The Lorentz force on this charge:

$$F = qvB \quad \text{(directed from P to Q)}$$

All charges experience the same force irrespective of their position. The work done in moving the charge from P to Q:

$$W = qvB\ell$$

Since emf = work done per unit charge:

$$\varepsilon = \frac{W}{q} = B\ell v$$

The total Lorentz force on a charge at any point in the conductor is:

$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

---

**OR**

**(a) Current in a pure inductor connected to AC source:**

[Diagram (circuit): An AC source $\varepsilon$ connected to a pure inductor $L$ in a simple loop.]

[Diagram (b) — Phasor diagram: The voltage phasor $V_m$ is along the positive x-axis (reference). The current phasor $I_m$ lags the voltage phasor by $\pi/2$ (i.e., at $-90°$ from $V_m$).]

[Diagram (c) — Graph: Plot of $v = v_m\sin\omega t$ (solid sinusoidal curve) and $i = i_m\sin(\omega t - \pi/2)$ (dashed sinusoidal curve, lagging by $\pi/2$) versus $\omega t$. The x-axis shows $0$, $\pi$, $2\pi$, etc. The current curve is shifted $\pi/2$ to the right compared to the voltage curve.]

Let the voltage across the source be $V = V_m \sin\omega t$.

Using Kirchhoff's loop rule (no resistor in the circuit):

$$v - L\frac{di}{dt} = 0 \quad \cdots (i)$$

From (i):

$$\frac{di}{dt} = \frac{v}{L} = \frac{V_m}{L}\sin\omega t \quad \cdots (ii)$$

Integrating:

$$\int \frac{di}{dt}\,dt = \frac{V_m}{L}\int \sin(\omega t)\,dt$$

$$i = -\frac{V_m}{\omega L}\cos(\omega t) + \text{const}$$

Since the current oscillates symmetrically about zero, the integration constant is zero. Using $-\cos(\omega t) = \sin\left(\omega t - \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$:

$$i = i_m \sin\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)$$

where the amplitude is:

$$i_m = \frac{V_m}{\omega L} = \frac{V_m}{X_L}$$

The quantity $X_L = \omega L$ is called the **inductive reactance** (SI unit: ohm, $\Omega$).

The current **lags** the applied voltage by $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ (90°).

**(b) Average power dissipated in a series LCR circuit:**

For a series LCR circuit driven by $v = v_m\sin\omega t$, the current is:

$$i = i_m\sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

where $i_m = \dfrac{v_m}{Z}$ and $\phi = \tan^{-1}\!\left(\dfrac{X_C - X_L}{R}\right)$.

The instantaneous power:

$$p = vi = (v_m\sin\omega t)\cdot[i_m\sin(\omega t + \phi)]$$

$$p = \frac{v_m i_m}{2}[\cos\phi - \cos(2\omega t + \phi)]$$

The **average power** over a complete cycle: the term $\cos(2\omega t + \phi)$ averages to zero, so:

$$P = \frac{v_m i_m}{2}\cos\phi = \frac{v_m}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{i_m}{\sqrt{2}}\cos\phi$$

$$\boxed{P = VI\cos\phi}$$

where $V$ and $I$ are the rms values of voltage and current, and $\cos\phi$ is called the **power factor**.

This can also be written as:

$$P = I^2 Z \cos\phi$$

### Q25.
(a) State Gauss's law in electrostatics. Show, with the help of a suitable example along with the figure, that the outward flux due to a point charge '$q$' in vacuum within a closed surface is independent of its size or shape and is given by $q/\varepsilon_0$.

(b) Two parallel uniformly charged infinite plane sheets, '1' and '2', have charge densities $+\sigma$ and $-2\sigma$ respectively. Give the magnitude and direction of the net electric field at a point:
(i) in between the two sheets and
(ii) outside near the sheet '1'.

**OR**

(a) Define electrostatic potential at a point. Write its S.I. unit. Three point charges $q_1$, $q_2$ and $q_3$ are kept respectively at points A, B and C as shown in the figure. Derive the expression for the electrostatic potential energy of the system.

(b) Depict the equipotential surfaces due to:
(i) an electric dipole,
(ii) two identical positive charges separated by a distance.

---

**Solution (Main):**

**(a) Gauss's Law:**

**Statement:** The electric flux linked with a closed surface is equal to $\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon_0}$ times the net charge enclosed by that closed surface.

**Mathematical expression:**

$$\phi_E = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{s} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0}(q_{net})$$

**Example showing independence of shape and size:**

[Diagram: Two concentric spherical surfaces — a smaller one of radius $r$ and a larger one of radius $2r$ — both surrounding the same point charge $q$ at the centre.]

Consider two spherical surfaces of radii $r$ and $2r$ respectively, both enclosing the same charge $q$:

- For the smaller sphere (radius $r$):

$$\phi_E = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$$

- For the larger sphere (radius $2r$):

$$\phi_E = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$$

Both give the same flux. The result is the same for **any shape** of closed surface enclosing the same charge $q$, demonstrating that the flux is **independent of the size or shape** of the closed surface — it depends only on the **charge enclosed**.

**(b)**

Let $\hat{r}$ be the unit vector directed from Plate 1 (charge density $+\sigma$) toward Plate 2 (charge density $-2\sigma$).

Each infinite plane sheet produces a uniform electric field of magnitude $\dfrac{\sigma_{surface}}{2\varepsilon_0}$ on each side.

The electric fields due to each plate:

**Due to Plate 1** ($+\sigma$): Field points away from it (in $+\hat{r}$ direction on the right side):
$$\vec{E}_1 = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{r}$$

**Due to Plate 2** ($-2\sigma$): Field points toward it (also in $+\hat{r}$ direction on the left side of Plate 2, i.e., between the plates):
$$\vec{E}_2 = \frac{2\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{r} = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\hat{r}$$

**(i) Electric field at point P (between the two sheets):**

Both fields point in the $+\hat{r}$ direction:

$$\vec{E} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 = \left(\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} + \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\right)\hat{r}$$

$$\boxed{\vec{E} = \frac{3\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{r}}$$

Direction: from Plate 1 toward Plate 2 (i.e., $+\hat{r}$).

**(ii) Electric field at point Q (outside, near Plate 1):**

On the outer side of Plate 1: $\vec{E}_1$ points in $-\hat{r}$ (away from Plate 1, outward), and $\vec{E}_2$ points in $+\hat{r}$ (toward Plate 2):

$$\vec{E}_1 = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}(-\hat{r}), \quad \vec{E}_2 = \frac{2\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}(+\hat{r})$$

$$\vec{E} = \vec{E}_1 + \vec{E}_2 = \left(-\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} + \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}\right)\hat{r}$$

$$\boxed{\vec{E} = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\hat{r}}$$

Direction: in $+\hat{r}$ direction (from Plate 1 toward Plate 2).

**OR**

**(a) Electrostatic potential:**

**Definition:** The electrostatic potential ($V$) at any point in a region with an electrostatic field is the **work done in bringing a unit positive charge (without acceleration) from infinity to that point**.

**S.I. Unit:** Volt (V) $= J/C$

[Diagram: Three point charges $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ at vertices A, B, C of a triangle. The distances between them are: $r_{12}$ (between $q_1$ and $q_2$), $r_{13}$ (between $q_1$ and $q_3$), and $r_{23}$ (between $q_2$ and $q_3$).]

**Potential energy of the system of three charges:**

To assemble the charges step by step:

**Step 1:** Bring $q_1$ from infinity to point A. No work required (no field yet):
$$W_1 = 0$$

**Step 2:** Bring $q_2$ from infinity to point B in the field of $q_1$:
$$W_2 = q_2 V_1(r_2) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} \quad \cdots (1)$$

**Step 3:** Bring $q_3$ from infinity to point C in the combined field of $q_1$ and $q_2$:

$$V_{1,2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\frac{q_1}{r_{1P}} + \frac{q_2}{r_{2P}}\right) \quad \cdots (2)$$

$$W_3 = q_3 V_{1,2}(\vec{r}_3) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\frac{q_1 q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{q_2 q_3}{r_{23}}\right) \quad \cdots (3)$$

The **total electrostatic potential energy** is:

$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\frac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}} + \frac{q_1 q_3}{r_{13}} + \frac{q_2 q_3}{r_{23}}\right)}$$

**(b) Equipotential surfaces:**

[Diagram (a) — Electric dipole: Equipotential surfaces are shown as a family of closed curves. Near the positive charge, the surfaces bulge outward; near the negative charge they curve inward. The surfaces are perpendicular to the field lines. The plane perpendicular to the dipole at its midpoint is a flat equipotential at $V = 0$.]

[Diagram (b) — Two identical positive charges: Equipotential surfaces are roughly circular around each charge individually at close range. At larger distances they merge into roughly elliptical surfaces. The plane perpendicularly bisecting the line joining the two charges is an equipotential (saddle point between the two charges).]

### Q26.
(a) A point-object is placed on the principal axis of a convex spherical surface of radius of curvature $R$, which separates the two media of refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$ ($n_2 > n_1$). Draw the ray diagram and deduce the relation between the distance of the object ($u$), distance of the image ($v$) and the radius of curvature ($R$) for refraction to take place at the convex spherical surface from rarer to denser medium.

(b) Use the above relation to obtain the condition on the position of the object and the radius of curvature in terms of $n_1$ and $n_2$ when a real image is formed.

**OR**

(a) Draw a labelled ray diagram showing the formation of image by a compound microscope in normal adjustment. Derive the expression for its magnifying power.

(b) How does the resolving power of a microscope change when:
(i) the diameter of the objective lens is decreased.
(ii) the wavelength of the incident light is increased?
Justify your answer in each case.

---

**Solution (Main):**

**(a) Refraction at a convex spherical surface:**

[Diagram: A convex spherical refracting surface separating medium $n_1$ (left, rarer) and $n_2$ (right, denser). Object O is on the principal axis to the left. A ray from O hits the surface at point N, gets refracted, and meets the axis at image point I to the right. C is the centre of curvature. M is the foot of perpendicular from N to the axis. Distances: OM = $u$ (negative by sign convention), MI = $v$ (positive), MC = $R$ (positive).]

For small angles (paraxial approximation), $NM \approx$ length of perpendicular from N to axis.

$$\tan\angle NOM = \frac{MN}{OM}, \quad \tan\angle NCM = \frac{MN}{MC}, \quad \tan\angle NIM = \frac{MN}{MI}$$

For $\triangle NOC$, $i$ is the exterior angle:

$$i = \angle NOM + \angle NCM = \frac{MN}{OM} + \frac{MN}{MC} \quad \cdots (1)$$

Similarly:

$$r = \angle NCM - \angle NIM = \frac{MN}{MC} - \frac{MN}{MI} \quad \cdots (2)$$

By Snell's law for small angles:

$$n_1 i = n_2 r$$

Substituting (1) and (2):

$$n_1\left(\frac{MN}{OM} + \frac{MN}{MC}\right) = n_2\left(\frac{MN}{MC} - \frac{MN}{MI}\right)$$

$$\frac{n_1}{OM} + \frac{n_2}{MI} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{MC} \quad \cdots (3)$$

Applying Cartesian sign convention: $OM = -u$, $MI = +v$, $MC = +R$:

$$\boxed{\frac{n_2}{v} - \frac{n_1}{u} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}} \quad \cdots (4)$$

This is the **refraction formula** at a convex spherical surface.

**(b) Condition for real image:**

For a real image, $v > 0$ (image on the transmission side). From equation (4):

$$\frac{n_2}{v} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} + \frac{n_1}{u}$$

Since the object is real, $u < 0$. For $v > 0$:

$$\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} + \frac{n_1}{u} > 0$$

$$\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} > -\frac{n_1}{u} = \frac{n_1}{|u|}$$

$$\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} > \frac{n_1}{|u|}$$

$$|u| > \frac{n_1 R}{n_2 - n_1}$$

So a **real image is formed when the object distance satisfies:**

$$|u| > \frac{n_1 R}{n_2 - n_1}$$

i.e., the object must be placed beyond the distance $\dfrac{n_1 R}{n_2 - n_1}$ from the surface.

**OR**

**(a) Compound Microscope — Ray Diagram and Magnifying Power:**

[Diagram: A compound microscope with two coaxial convex lenses. The objective lens (focal length $f_o$, small) is on the left; the eyepiece (focal length $f_e$, small) is on the right. The object AB (height $h$) is placed just beyond the focus of the objective. The objective forms a real, inverted, magnified image A'B' (height $h'$) just inside the focal point of the eyepiece. The eyepiece then acts as a simple magnifier and forms the final virtual, enlarged image A''B'' at infinity (normal adjustment). The tube length $L$ is the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece.]

**Working:** 
- The **objective** forms a real, inverted, magnified intermediate image A'B' of the object AB. This image falls near the focal point of the eyepiece.
- The **eyepiece** acts as a simple magnifier, producing a final virtual image that is further magnified.

**Magnification due to objective** (linear magnification):

$$m_o = \frac{h'}{h} = \frac{L}{f_o}$$

where $L$ is the tube length (distance between second focal point of objective and first focal point of eyepiece), obtained using:

$$\tan\beta = \frac{h}{f_o} = \frac{h'}{L}$$

**Magnification due to eyepiece** (for image at infinity — normal adjustment):

$$m_e = \frac{D}{f_e}$$

**Total magnification (normal adjustment):**

$$m = m_o \times m_e = \frac{L}{f_o} \times \frac{D}{f_e}$$

$$\boxed{m = \frac{L \cdot D}{f_o \cdot f_e}}$$

For large magnification, both $f_o$ and $f_e$ should be **small**.

**(b) Resolving power of a microscope:**

The resolving power of a microscope is given by:

$$RP = \frac{1}{d_{
