### Q1.
Using the concept of force between two infinitely long parallel current carrying conductors, define one ampere of current.

**Answer:**
One ampere is the value of steady current which when maintained in each of the two very long, straight, parallel conductors of negligible cross-section and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce on each of these conductors a force equal to $2 \times 10^{-7}$ N per metre of its length.

**Solution:**

*Alternatively:*

If the student writes:

$$F = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi} \frac{I_1 I_2}{R} L$$

and states that when $I_1 = I_2 = 1$ ampere, $R = 1$ metre and $L = 1$ metre, then:

$$F = 2 \times 10^{-7} \ N$$

*Alternatively:*

### Q2.
To which part of the electromagnetic spectrum does a wave of frequency $5 \times 10^{19}$ Hz belong?

**Answer:** X-rays / $\gamma$-rays

---

### Q3.
Two equal balls having equal positive charge $q$ coulombs are suspended by two insulating strings of equal length. What would be the effect on the force when a plastic sheet is inserted between the two?

**Answer:** Force decreases.

**Solution:** Inserting a plastic (dielectric) sheet between the charged balls increases the permittivity of the medium between them, thereby reducing the electrostatic force between the charges.

---

### Q4.
Define intensity of radiation on the basis of the photon picture of light. Write its S.I. unit.

**Answer:**
Intensity of radiation depends on the number of photons incident per unit area per unit time.

**Solution:**
*[Note: Also accept the definition: 'number of quanta of radiation per unit area per unit time'. Also accept if the student writes: All photons, of a particular frequency, have the same kinetic energy and momentum, irrespective of the intensity of incident radiation.]*

*Alternatively:* The amount of light energy/photon energy incident per metre square per second is called intensity of radiation.

**S.I. Unit:** $W/m^2$ or $J/(s \cdot m^2)$

### Q5.
The electric current flowing in a wire in the direction from B to A is decreasing. Find out the direction of the induced current in the metallic loop kept above the wire as shown.

[Diagram: A straight horizontal wire with current direction from B (right) to A (left), and a small circular/rectangular metallic loop placed above the wire.]

**Answer:** Clockwise

**Solution:**
*Alternatively:*

[Diagram: Shows the loop above the wire with induced current flowing in the clockwise direction (when viewed from above), consistent with Lenz's law — as the current from B to A decreases, the magnetic flux through the loop (directed into the page below the wire) decreases, so the induced current opposes this change by flowing clockwise to maintain the flux.]

---

### Q6.
Why is it found experimentally difficult to detect neutrinos in nuclear $\beta$-decay?

**Answer:** Neutrinos are neutral (chargeless), (almost) massless particles that hardly interact with matter.

**Solution:**

*Alternatively:*
- The neutrinos can penetrate a large quantity of matter without any interaction.

**OR**

- Neutrinos are chargeless and (almost) massless particles.

---

### Q7.
Why is the use of a.c. voltage preferred over d.c. voltage? Give two reasons.

**Answer:** Any **two** of the following (or any other correct) reasons:

1. AC can be transmitted with much lower energy losses as compared to DC.
2. AC voltage can be adjusted (stepped up or stepped down) as per requirement using transformers.
3. AC current in a circuit can be controlled using (almost) wattless devices like the choke coil.
4. AC is easier to generate.

---

### Q8.
A biconvex lens made of a transparent material of refractive index 1.25 is immersed in water of refractive index 1.33. Will the lens behave as a converging or a diverging lens? Give reason.

**Answer:** As a **diverging lens**.

**Solution:** Since the refractive index of the lens material (1.25) is less than the refractive index of the surrounding medium — water (1.33) — the lens behaves as if it is in a denser medium. Light rays diverge on going from a rarer to a denser medium.

*[Alternatively: Also accept the reason given on the basis of the lens maker's formula.]*

### Q9.
Using Rutherford model of the atom, derive the expression for the total energy of the electron in hydrogen atom. What is the significance of total negative energy possessed by the electron?

**OR**

Using Bohr's postulates of the atomic model, derive the expression for radius of $n^{th}$ electron orbit. Hence obtain the expression for Bohr's radius.

**Answer (Main Question):**

**Solution:**

As per Rutherford's model, the centripetal force is provided by the electrostatic force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{ze^2}{r^2}$$

$$\Rightarrow mv^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{ze^2}{r}$$

**Total Energy** = P.E + K.E:

$$= -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{ze^2}{r} + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

$$= -\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{ze^2}{r} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{ze^2}{r}$$

$$= -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{ze^2}{r} = -\frac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{ze^2}{r}$$

[Diagram: An electron $e$ orbiting a nucleus $+ze$ at radius $r$.]

**Significance of Negative Sign:** The negative total energy implies that the electron–nucleus system forms a **bound system**.

*Alternatively: The electron–nucleus system forms an attractive system.*

---

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative — Bohr's Postulates):**

**Bohr's Postulate:**

$$mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi}$$

For the electron, the electrostatic force provides centripetal force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{ze^2}{r^2}$$

From Bohr's postulate:

$$m^2v^2r^2 = \frac{n^2h^2}{4\pi^2}$$

And:

$$mv^2 r = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} ze^2$$

Dividing:

$$r = \frac{\varepsilon_0 \, n^2 h^2}{\pi z e^2 m}$$

**Bohr's radius** (for $n = 1$, $z = 1$):

$$a_0 = \frac{\varepsilon_0 h^2}{\pi e^2 m}$$

---

### Q10.
A parallel plate capacitor of capacitance $C$ is charged to a potential $V$. It is then connected to another uncharged capacitor having the same capacitance. Find out the ratio of the energy stored in the combined system to that stored initially in the single capacitor.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

Energy stored in a capacitor:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}QV = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2C} \quad \text{(any one)}$$

Capacitance of the (parallel) combination $= C + C = 2C$

Here, the total charge $Q$ remains the same.

$$\therefore \text{Initial energy} = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$$

$$\text{Final energy} = \frac{Q^2}{2 \times 2C} = \frac{Q^2}{4C}$$

$$\therefore \frac{\text{Final energy}}{\text{Initial energy}} = \frac{Q^2/4C}{Q^2/2C} = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$\boxed{\text{Ratio} = 1 : 2}$$

*[Note: If the student does the correct calculations by assuming the voltage across the (i) Parallel or (ii) Series combination to remain constant (= V) and obtains the answers as (i) 2:1 or (ii) 1:2, award full marks.]*

---

### Q11.
Considering the case of a parallel plate capacitor being charged, show how one is required to generalize Ampere's circuital law to include the term due to displacement current.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Ampere's Circuital Law:**

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I$$

[Diagram (a): A capacitor being charged by current $I(t)$, with a flat Amperian surface cutting through the wire — giving non-zero enclosed current.]

[Diagram (b): An Amperian surface that bulges between the capacitor plates — through which no conduction current passes.]

[Diagram (c): Another Amperian surface passing through the region between the plates — showing contradiction.]

Applying Ampere's circuital law to **Fig. (a)**: during charging, the right-hand side equals $\mu_0 I$.

However, applying it to the surfaces of **Fig. (b)** or **Fig. (c)**: the right-hand side is **zero**.

Hence, there is a **contradiction**.

This contradiction can be removed by assuming that a current exists associated with the changing electric field during charging, known as the **displacement current**:

$$I_d = \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

When this term is added to the right-hand side, the inconsistency disappears. It was therefore necessary to **generalize** Ampere's circuital law as:

$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_c + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

*[Note: If the student does the reasoning by using the detailed mathematics relevant to displacement current, award full 2 marks.]*

### Q12.
A cell of emf $E$ and internal resistance $r$ is connected across a variable resistor $R$. Plot a graph showing variation of terminal voltage $V$ of the cell versus the current $I$. Using the plot, show how the emf of the cell and its internal resistance can be determined.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

The relation between $V$ and $I$ is:

$$V = E - Ir$$

Hence the graph between $V$ and $I$ is a straight line with a negative slope.

[Diagram: A graph with $V$ on the y-axis and $I$ on the x-axis. The straight line starts at point A on the y-axis (where $I = 0$, $V = E$) and meets the x-axis at point B (where $V = 0$, $I = I_B$). The line has a negative slope.]

- At point **A**: $I = 0$, hence $V_A = E$
  → The **y-intercept gives the emf** $E$ of the cell.

- At point **B**: $V = 0$, hence $E = I_B r$

$$\therefore r = \frac{E}{I_B}$$

*Alternatively:* emf $E$ equals the intercept on the vertical axis. Internal resistance $r$ equals the **negative of the slope** of the graph.

---

### Q13.
Explain, with the help of a circuit diagram, the working of a p-n junction diode as a half-wave rectifier.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Circuit diagram showing an AC source connected to the primary of a transformer. The secondary is connected in series with a p-n junction diode (anode to X, cathode toward load). A load resistor $R_L$ is connected between points X and Y (output terminals). The circuit shows the transformer, diode, and $R_L$ in series.]

**Working:**

- During **one half** of the input AC cycle, the diode is **forward biased** and a current flows through $R_L$.
- During the **other half** of the input AC cycle, the diode is **reverse biased** and no current flows through the load $R_L$.
- Hence, the given AC input is **rectified** — only one half of the AC cycle appears across the load.

*[Note: If the student just draws the waveforms for the input AC voltage and output voltage without giving any explanation, award ½ mark only for "working".]*

### Q14.
Estimate the average drift speed of conduction electrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area $1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ m² carrying a current of 1.5 A. Assume the density of conduction electrons to be $9 \times 10^{28}$ m⁻³.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

Using the relation $I = neAV_d$:

$$V_d = \frac{I}{neA} = \frac{1.5}{9 \times 10^{28} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 1.0 \times 10^{-7}} \ m/s$$

$$\boxed{V_d = 1.048 \times 10^{-3} \ m/s \ (\approx 1 \ mm/s)}$$

### Q15.
Two monochromatic rays of light are incident normally on the face AB of an isosceles right-angled prism ABC. The refractive indices of the glass prism for the two rays '1' and '2' are respectively 1.35 and 1.45. Trace the path of these rays after entering through the prism.

[Diagram: An isosceles right-angled prism ABC with the right angle at B. Face AB is vertical on the left, face BC is horizontal at the bottom, and face AC is the hypotenuse on the right. Angle at A = 45°, angle at C = 45°. Rays '1' and '2' travel horizontally and are incident normally on face AB.]

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

The critical angle $\theta_c$ for a medium with refractive index $\mu$ is given by $\sin\theta_c = \frac{1}{\mu}$.

When rays '1' and '2' enter face AB normally, they travel without bending and strike face AC at an angle of **45°**.

**For Ray '1'** ($\mu = 1.35$):

$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{1}{1.35} = 0.741 \Rightarrow \theta_c \approx 47.8°$$

Since the angle of incidence (45°) < critical angle (47.8°), ray '1' is **refracted** (transmitted) through face AC.

**For Ray '2'** ($\mu = 1.45$):

$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{1}{1.45} = 0.690 \Rightarrow \theta_c \approx 43.6°$$

Since the angle of incidence (45°) > critical angle (43.6°), ray '2' undergoes **total internal reflection** at face AC and exits through face BC (downward).

[Diagram: Prism with apex A at top, B at bottom-left, C at bottom-right. Ray '1' enters face AB horizontally, hits face AC at 45°, refracts and exits to the right. Ray '2' enters face AB horizontally, hits face AC at 45°, undergoes total internal reflection, and exits downward through face BC.]

*[Note: If the student just writes (without drawing any diagram) that the angle of incidence for both rays '1' and '2' on face AC equals 45°, and says that it is less than the critical angle for ray '1' (which therefore gets refracted) and more than the critical angle for ray '2' (which undergoes total internal reflection), award only ½ + ½ marks.]*

### Q16.
Write the functions of the following in communication systems:
(i) Transducer
(ii) Repeater

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(i) Transducer:** Any device that converts one form of energy to another.
*(Example: A microphone converts sound energy into electrical energy.)*

**(ii) Repeater:** A repeater accepts the signal from the transmitter, amplifies it, and retransmits it to the receiver. It is used to extend the range of communication.

---

### Q17.
Show diagrammatically the behaviour of magnetic field lines in the presence of (i) paramagnetic and (ii) diamagnetic substances. How does one explain this distinguishing feature?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

[Diagram 1 — Paramagnetic: Horizontal magnetic field lines passing through a rectangular slab. The field lines are denser (more concentrated) inside the paramagnetic material, showing the field is strengthened inside.]

[Diagram 2 — Diamagnetic: Horizontal magnetic field lines passing through a rectangular slab. The field lines are less dense (sparse/bent away) inside the diamagnetic material, showing the field is weakened inside.]

**Explanation:**

- A **paramagnetic** material tends to move from weaker to stronger regions of the magnetic field and hence **increases** the number of lines of magnetic field passing through it.
  *[Alternatively: In a paramagnetic material, dipole moments are induced in the direction of the field.]*

- A **diamagnetic** material tends to move from stronger to weaker regions of the magnetic field and hence **decreases** the number of lines of magnetic field passing through it.
  *[Alternatively: In a diamagnetic material, dipole moments are induced in the opposite direction of the field.]*

*[Note: If the student just writes that a paramagnetic material has a small positive susceptibility ($0 < \chi < \infty$) and a diamagnetic material has a negative susceptibility ($-1 \leq \chi < 0$), award ½ mark for the second part of the question.]*

---

### Q18.
Draw a circuit diagram of n-p-n transistor amplifier in CE configuration. Under what condition does the transistor act as an amplifier?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Common-emitter (CE) amplifier circuit with an NPN transistor. The base terminal is connected through base resistor $R_B$ to input voltage source $V_i$ and bias battery $V_{BB}$. The collector is connected through collector resistor $R_C$ to supply voltage $V_{CC}$. The emitter is grounded. Output voltage $V_o$ is taken across $R_C$. Currents $I_B$, $I_C$, and $I_E$ are labelled.]

**Condition:** The transistor must be operated close to the **centre of its active region**.

*Alternatively:* The base–emitter junction of the transistor must be **(suitably) forward biased** and the collector–emitter junction must be **(suitably) reverse biased**.

### Q19.
**(a)** Using the phenomenon of polarisation, show how the transverse nature of light can be demonstrated.

**(b)** Two polaroids $P_1$ and $P_2$ are placed with their pass axes perpendicular to each other. Unpolarised light of intensity $I_o$ is incident on $P_1$. A third polaroid $P_3$ is kept in between $P_1$ and $P_2$ such that its pass axis makes an angle of 30° with that of $P_1$. Determine the intensity of light transmitted through $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Demonstration of Transverse Nature of Light:**

[Diagram: Two setups — Left: A single polaroid $P_1$ with unpolarised light passing through it, becoming plane-polarised. Rotating $P_1$ shows no variation in intensity. Right: Two polaroids $P_1$ and $P_2$ in tandem. As $P_2$ is rotated, the transmitted intensity varies from maximum to zero and back to maximum.]

Light from the sodium lamp passing through the single Polaroid sheet ($P_1$) does **not** show any variation in intensity when this sheet is rotated.

However, if the light transmitted by $P_1$ is made to pass through another Polaroid sheet ($P_2$), the light intensity coming out of $P_2$ varies from a **maximum to zero, and again to maximum**, when $P_2$ is rotated.

These observations are consistent **only** with the **transverse nature** of light waves.

---

**(b) Calculation of Intensities:**

**Through $P_1$:**

$$I_{P_1} = \frac{I_0}{2}$$

**Through $P_3$** (angle between $P_3$ and $P_1$ is 30°, using Malus's Law):

$$I_{P_3} = I_{P_1} \cos^2 30° = \frac{I_0}{2} \times \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3I_0}{8}$$

**Through $P_2$** (angle between $P_2$ and $P_3$ is $90° - 30° = 60°$):

$$I_{P_2} = I_{P_3} \cos^2 60° = \frac{3I_0}{8} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3I_0}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3I_0}{32}$$

$$\boxed{I_{P_1} = \frac{I_0}{2}, \quad I_{P_3} = \frac{3I_0}{8}, \quad I_{P_2} = \frac{3I_0}{32}}$$

*[Note: If the student takes the intensity of light transmitted through $P_1$ as $I_o$ and calculates the intensity through $P_3$ and $P_2$ as $\frac{3}{4}I_o$ and $\frac{3}{16}I_o$, award 1 mark for part (b).]*

### Q20.
Define the term 'mutual inductance' between two coils. Obtain the expression for mutual inductance of a pair of long coaxial solenoids each of length $l$ and radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ ($r_2 >> r_1$). Total number of turns in the two solenoids are $N_1$ and $N_2$ respectively.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Definition:** Mutual inductance, between a pair of coils, equals the **magnetic flux linked with one of them due to a unit current flowing in the other**.

*Alternatively:* The mutual inductance, for a pair of coils, equals the **emf induced in one of them when the current in the other coil is changing at a unit rate**.

---

**Derivation:**

[Diagram: Two coaxial solenoids — outer solenoid $S_2$ with $N_2$ turns and radius $r_2$, and inner solenoid $S_1$ with $N_1$ turns and radius $r_1$, both of length $l$.]

Let a current $I_2$ flow through the outer coil (solenoid 2).

The magnetic field due to this current inside the solenoid:

$$B = \mu_0 \frac{N_2}{l} \times I_2$$

The resulting magnetic flux linked with the inner coil (solenoid 1):

$$\Phi_{12} = N_1 \cdot \left(\mu_0 \frac{N_2}{l} \times I_2\right) \times \pi r_1^2$$

$$= \left(\mu_0 \frac{N_1 N_2}{l} \cdot \pi r_1^2\right) I_2$$

By definition, $\Phi_{12} = M_{12} \cdot I_2$, therefore:

$$\boxed{M_{12} = \mu_0 \frac{N_1 N_2}{l} \cdot \pi r_1^2}$$

---

### Q21.
Answer the following:
(a) Why are the connections between the resistors in a meter bridge made of thick copper strips?
(b) Why is it generally preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire?
(c) Which material is used for the meter bridge wire and why?

**OR**

A resistance of $R\ \Omega$ draws current from a potentiometer as shown in the figure. The potentiometer has a total resistance $R_0\ \Omega$. A voltage $V$ is supplied to the potentiometer. Derive an expression for the voltage across $R$ when the sliding contact is in the middle of the potentiometer.

[Diagram: A potentiometer wire AC of total resistance $R_0$ connected to voltage source $V$. A sliding contact (jockey) is at the midpoint. A resistance $R$ is connected between the midpoint and one end (say A) of the potentiometer wire.]

**Answer (Main Question):**

**(a)** This is to ensure that the connections do **not contribute any extra, unknown resistances** in the circuit.

**(b)** This is done to **minimize the percentage error** in the value of the unknown resistance.

*[Alternatively: This is done to have a better "balancing out" of the effects of any irregularity or non-uniformity in the metre bridge wire. Or: This can help in increasing the sensitivity of the metre bridge circuit.]*

**(c)** Material used: **Manganin / Constantan / Nichrome**

Reason: This material has a **low temperature coefficient of resistance** / **high resistivity** (any one).

---

**OR**

**Solution:**

When the sliding contact is in the middle, the potentiometer wire is divided into two equal halves, each of resistance $\frac{R_0}{2}$.

The lower half $\left(\frac{R_0}{2}\right)$ is in **parallel** with $R$.

Equivalent resistance of the parallel combination:

$$R_{parallel} = \frac{\dfrac{R_0}{2} \cdot R}{\dfrac{R_0}{2} + R} = \frac{R_0 R}{R_0 + 2R}$$

Total resistance of the circuit:

$$R_{total} = \frac{R_0}{2} + \frac{R_0 R}{R_0 + 2R} = \frac{R_0(R_0 + 2R) + 2R_0 R}{2(R_0 + 2R)} = \frac{R_0^2 + 4R_0 R}{2(R_0 + 2R)} = \frac{R_0(R_0 + 4R)}{2(R_0 + 2R)}$$

Total current drawn from the source:

$$I_{total} = \frac{V}{R_{total}} = \frac{2V(R_0 + 2R)}{R_0(R_0 + 4R)}$$

Current through $R$ (using current divider):

$$I_2 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_0/2}{R_0/2 + R} = I_{total} \times \frac{R_0}{R_0 + 2R}$$

$$= \frac{2V(R_0 + 2R)}{R_0(R_0 + 4R)} \times \frac{R_0}{R_0 + 2R} = \frac{2V}{R_0 + 4R}$$

**Voltage across $R$:**

$$V_R = I_2 \times R = \frac{2VR}{R_0 + 4R}$$

$$\boxed{V_R = \frac{2VR}{R_0 + 4R}}$$

### Q22.
A convex lens of focal length 20 cm is placed coaxially with a convex mirror of radius of curvature 20 cm. The two are kept at 15 cm from each other. A point object lies 60 cm in front of the convex lens. Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of the image by the combination. Determine the nature and position of the image formed.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

[Diagram: A convex lens L is placed with its optical centre at O. A convex mirror with pole at O' is placed 15 cm to the right of the lens. A point object P is placed 60 cm to the left of the lens. Rays from P refract through the lens converging toward a point, then reflect from the convex mirror, and the final virtual image is formed to the right of the mirror at Q (30 cm from mirror). The diagram shows incident rays, refracted rays, reflected rays, and image positions.]

**Step 1 — For the convex lens:**

$u = -60$ cm, $f = +20$ cm

Using the lens formula:

$$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$$

$$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{-60} = \frac{1}{20}$$

$$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{20} - \frac{1}{60} = \frac{3-1}{60} = \frac{2}{60}$$

$$v = +30 \text{ cm}$$

So the image formed by the lens is 30 cm to the **right** of the lens.

---

**Step 2 — For the convex mirror:**

This image acts as a virtual object for the convex mirror.

Distance of object from mirror: $u = +(30 - 15) = +15$ cm

Focal length of convex mirror: $f = +\frac{R}{2} = +\frac{20}{2} = +10$ cm

Using the mirror formula:

$$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$$

$$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{10}$$

$$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{15} = \frac{3-2}{30} = \frac{1}{30}$$

$$v = +30 \text{ cm}$$

**Final image** is formed at a distance of **30 cm to the right of the convex mirror** (i.e., 45 cm to the right of the convex lens).

**Nature:** The final image formed is a **virtual image**.

### Q23.
A voltage $V = V_0 \sin\omega t$ is applied to a series LCR circuit. Derive the expression for the average power dissipated over a cycle. Under what condition is (i) no power dissipated even though the current flows through the circuit, (ii) maximum power dissipated in the circuit?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Applied voltage:** $V = V_0 \sin\omega t$

**Current in the circuit:** $I = I_0 \sin(\omega t - \phi)$

where $\phi$ is the phase lag of the current with respect to the voltage.

**Instantaneous power dissipation:**

$$P_{inst} = V_0 \sin\omega t \times I_0 \sin(\omega t - \phi)$$

$$= \frac{V_0 I_0}{2} \left[2\sin\omega t \cdot \sin(\omega t - \phi)\right]$$

$$= \frac{V_0 I_0}{2} \left[\cos\phi - \cos(2\omega t - \phi)\right]$$

**Average power over one complete cycle:**

$$P_{avg} = \left\langle \frac{V_0 I_0}{2}\left[\cos\phi - \cos(2\omega t - \phi)\right] \right\rangle$$

The average of $\cos(2\omega t - \phi)$ over a complete cycle is **zero**.

$$\therefore \boxed{P_{avg} = \frac{V_0 I_0}{2}\cos\phi}$$

*[Note: Also accept alternative correct approach.]*

---

**Conditions:**

**(i) No power dissipated** (even though current flows):

When $R = 0$ (or $\phi = 90°$), then $\cos\phi = 0$, so $P_{avg} = 0$.

*[Note: Also accept if the student writes "This condition cannot be satisfied for a series LCR circuit".]*

**(ii) Maximum power dissipated:**

When $X_L = X_C$, i.e., $\omega L = \dfrac{1}{\omega C}$ (or $\phi = 0$), then $\cos\phi = 1$ (maximum), giving maximum power dissipation.

### Q24.
Write any two distinguishing features between conductors, semiconductors and insulators on the basis of energy band diagrams.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

[Diagram (a) — Conductor: The conduction band and valence band overlap (or nearly overlap), with energy gap $E_g \approx 0$.]

[Diagram (b) — Insulator: A large energy gap ($E_g > 3$ eV) separates the filled valence band from the empty conduction band.]

[Diagram (c) — Semiconductor: A small energy gap ($E_g < 3$ eV) separates the valence band from the conduction band.]

**Two Distinguishing Features:**

**(i)** In **conductors**, the valence band and conduction band tend to **overlap** (or nearly overlap); while in **insulators** they are separated by a **large energy gap** ($E_g > 3$ eV), and in **semiconductors** they are separated by a **small energy gap** ($E_g < 3$ eV).

**(ii)** The conduction band of a **conductor** has a large number of electrons available for electrical conduction. However, the conduction band of **insulators** is almost **empty**, while that of a **semiconductor** has only a very small number of such electrons available for electrical conduction.

### Q25. (Value Based Question)
For the past some time, Aarti had been observing some erratic body movement, unsteadiness and lack of coordination in the activities of her sister Radha, who also used to complain of severe headache occasionally. Aarti suggested to her parents to get a medical check-up of Radha. The doctor thoroughly examined Radha and diagnosed that she has a brain tumour.

(a) What, according to you, are the values displayed by Aarti?
(b) How can radioisotopes help a doctor to diagnose brain tumour?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) Values displayed by Aarti** (any two):
- Keen observer
- Helpful
- Concerned
- Responsible
- Respectful towards elders

**(b)** The doctor can trace and observe the **difference between the movement of an appropriate radioisotope through a normal brain and a brain having a tumour** in it. The radioisotope, when introduced into the body, is selectively absorbed by the tumour. Its movement/accumulation can be tracked using detectors, thereby locating the tumour.

### Q26.
Write two basic modes of communication. Explain the process of amplitude modulation. Draw a schematic sketch showing how an amplitude modulated signal is obtained by superposing a modulating signal over a sinusoidal carrier wave.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**Two basic modes of communication are:**

1. Point-to-point
2. Broadcast

**Amplitude Modulation:**

In Amplitude Modulation (AM), the **amplitude** of a carrier wave is made to **vary with time** in the same way as the modulating signal varies with time. The frequency and phase of the carrier wave remain unchanged.

If the carrier wave is $c(t) = A_c \sin\omega_c t$ and the modulating signal is $m(t) = A_m \sin\omega_m t$, the AM wave is:

$$c_{AM}(t) = (A_c + A_m \sin\omega_m t)\sin\omega_c t$$

[Diagram: Three waveforms stacked vertically.
- Top: Modulating signal — a low-frequency sine wave.
- Middle: Carrier wave — a high-frequency sine wave of constant amplitude.
- Bottom: AM signal — a high-frequency wave whose amplitude envelope follows the shape of the modulating signal (amplitude varies between a maximum and minimum). The envelope of the AM signal replicates the modulating signal.]

### Q27.
An electron microscope uses electrons accelerated by a voltage of 50 kV. Determine the de-Broglie wavelength associated with the electrons. Taking other factors, such as numerical aperture etc. to be same, how does the resolving power of an electron microscope compare with that of an optical microscope which uses yellow light?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

Using the de-Broglie wavelength formula:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}} \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = \frac{12.27}{\sqrt{V}} \ \mathring{A}$$

$$\therefore \lambda = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}{\sqrt{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \times 50 \times 10^3}}$$

$$\boxed{\lambda = 5.33 \times 10^{-12} \ m}$$

**Comparison:**

The wavelength of yellow light $\approx 590$ nm $= 5.9 \times 10^{-7}$ m, which is much larger than $5.33 \times 10^{-12}$ m.

Since resolving power $\propto \dfrac{1}{\lambda}$, the **resolving power of an electron microscope is much better** than that of an optical microscope.

*[Note: If the student writes R.P. $\propto \dfrac{1}{\lambda}$, award ½ mark.]*

### Q28.
Draw a labelled diagram of Van de Graaff generator. State its working principle to show how by introducing a small charged sphere into a larger sphere, a large amount of charge can be transferred to the outer sphere. State the use of this machine and also point out its limitations.

**OR**

**(a)** Deduce the expression for the torque acting on a dipole of dipole moment $\vec{p}$ in the presence of a uniform electric field $\vec{E}$.

**(b)** Consider two hollow concentric spheres, $S_1$ and $S_2$, enclosing charges $2Q$ and $4Q$ respectively as shown in the figure.
(i) Find out the ratio of the electric flux through them.
(ii) How will the electric flux through the sphere $S_1$ change if a medium of dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r$ is introduced in the space inside $S_1$ in place of air? Deduce the necessary expression.

[Diagram: Two concentric spheres. Inner sphere $S_1$ encloses charge $2Q$. Outer sphere $S_2$ encloses both $2Q$ (on $S_1$) and an additional $4Q$ charge between the spheres, for a total enclosed charge of $6Q$.]

**Answer (Main Question):**

**Solution:**

[Diagram: Labelled Van de Graaff generator showing:
- A large spherical conducting shell (outer sphere) at the top
- An insulating supporting column
- A motor-driven pulley at the bottom
- A pulley at the top inside the sphere
- An insulating belt running between the two pulleys
- A metal brush at the bottom delivering charge from an external source onto the belt
- A metal brush at the top inside the sphere collecting charge from the belt and transferring it to the outer sphere
- A grounded metal base]

**Principle and Working:**

Consider a small conducting sphere of radius $r$ carrying charge $q$, placed inside a larger conducting sphere of radius $R$ carrying charge $Q$.

**(i)** Potential inside and on the surface of the large conducting sphere of radius $R$:

$$V'_R = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Q}{R}$$

**(ii)** Potential due to the small sphere of radius $r$ carrying charge $q$:

At the surface of the smaller sphere:

$$V'_r = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r}$$

At the surface of the larger sphere (due to $q$):

$$V''_R = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{R}$$

The potential difference between the smaller and larger sphere:

$$\Delta V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left[\left(\frac{Q}{R} + \frac{q}{r}\right) - \left(\frac{Q}{R} + \frac{q}{R}\right)\right]$$

$$= \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R}\right)$$

When $q$ is positive (and $r < R$), the inner sphere is **always at a higher potential** than the outer sphere, irrespective of the amount of charge $Q$ on the outer sphere.

$\therefore$ When both spheres are connected, charge flows from the smaller to the larger sphere. Thus charge keeps **accumulating** on the larger sphere.

**Use:** This machine is used to **accelerate charged particles** (electrons, protons, ions) to high energies.

**Limitation:** It can build up potentials up to only a **few million volts**.

**OR**

**Solution:**

**(a) Torque on an Electric Dipole in a Uniform Electric Field:**

[Diagram: An electric dipole with charge $+q$ at point B and $-q$ at point A, separated by distance $2a$. The dipole moment $\vec{p}$ makes angle $\theta$ with the uniform electric field $\vec{E}$. Forces $+q\vec{E}$ (upward at B) and $-q\vec{E}$ (downward at A) are shown. The perpendicular distance for the torque is $AC = 2a\sin\theta$.]

The forces acting on the two charges of the dipole are:

$$+q\vec{E} \quad \text{and} \quad -q\vec{E}$$

The **net force** on the dipole is zero (equal and opposite forces).

The two forces constitute a **couple** (torque) of magnitude:

$$\tau = (qE) \times AC = qE \cdot 2a\sin\theta = pE\sin\theta$$

The direction of this torque is that of the cross product $\left(\vec{p} \times \vec{E}\right)$.

Hence, the torque acting on the dipole is:

$$\boxed{\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}}$$

---

**(b) Electric Flux through Concentric Spheres:**

As per **Gauss's Theorem**:

$$\text{Electric Flux} = \oint_S \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} = \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\varepsilon_0}$$

**(i) Ratio of electric flux:**

For sphere $S_1$ (encloses charge $2Q$):

$$\phi_1 = \frac{2Q}{\varepsilon_0}$$

For sphere $S_2$ (encloses total charge $2Q + 4Q = 6Q$):

$$\phi_2 = \frac{2Q + 4Q}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{6Q}{\varepsilon_0}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{\phi_1}{\phi_2} = \frac{2Q}{6Q} = \frac{1}{3}}$$

**(ii) Effect of dielectric medium inside $S_1$:**

When a medium of dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r$ is introduced inside $S_1$, Gauss's law becomes:

$$\phi'_1 = \frac{2Q}{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} = \frac{2Q}{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0}$$

The **electric flux through $S_1$ decreases** by a factor of $\varepsilon_r$.

*[Note: If the student just writes that the flux through $S_1$ decreases, award ½ mark only.]*

### Q29.
**(a)** In Young's double slit experiment, describe briefly how bright and dark fringes are obtained on the screen kept in front of a double slit. Hence obtain the expression for the fringe width.

**(b)** The ratio of the intensities at minima to the maxima in Young's double slit experiment is 9 : 25. Find the ratio of the widths of the two slits.

**OR**

**(a)** Describe briefly how a diffraction pattern is obtained on a screen due to a single narrow slit illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. Hence obtain the conditions for the angular width of secondary maxima and secondary minima.

**(b)** Two wavelengths of sodium light of 590 nm and 596 nm are used in turn to study the diffraction taking place at a single slit of aperture $2 \times 10^{-6}$ m. The distance between the slit and the screen is 1.5 m. Calculate the separation between the positions of first maxima of the diffraction pattern obtained in the two cases.

**Answer (Main Question):**

**Solution:**

**(a) Formation of Bright and Dark Fringes and Fringe Width:**

[Diagram: Two slits $S_1$ and $S_2$ separated by distance $d$, placed at distance $D$ from the screen. A point P on the screen at height $x$ from the central point O. The path difference $S_2P - S_1P$ is shown.]

The light rays from the two (coherent) slits, reaching a point P on the screen, have a path difference $(S_2P - S_1P)$.

Point P will be:

- **Bright fringe (maxima):** if $S_2P - S_1P = n\lambda$ (where $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$)
- **Dark fringe (minima):** if $S_2P - S_1P = (2n+1)\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$

**Derivation of path difference:**

$$(S_2P)^2 - (S_1P)^2 = \left\{D^2 + \left(x + \frac{d}{2}\right)^2\right\} - \left\{D^2 + \left(x - \frac{d}{2}\right)^2\right\} = 2xd$$

$$S_2P - S_1P = \frac{2xd}{S_2P + S_1P} \approx \frac{2xd}{2D} = \frac{xd}{D}$$

**Condition for maxima:**

$$\frac{xd}{D} = n\lambda \Rightarrow x_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$

**Condition for minima:**

$$\frac{xd}{D} = \left(\frac{2n+1}{2}\right)\lambda$$

**Fringe width** $\beta$ = separation between two successive maxima (or minima):

$$\beta = x_n - x_{n-1} = \frac{n\lambda D}{d} - \frac{(n-1)\lambda D}{d}$$

$$\boxed{\beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d}}$$

---

**(b) Ratio of widths of the two slits:**

Given:

$$\frac{I_{max}}{I_{min}} = \frac{25}{9}$$

We know:

$$\frac{I_{max}}{I_{min}} = \frac{(a_1 + a_2)^2}{(a_1 - a_2)^2} = \frac{25}{9}$$

Taking square roots:

$$\frac{a_1 + a_2}{a_1 - a_2} = \frac{5}{3}$$

$$3(a_1 + a_2) = 5(a_1 - a_2)$$

$$3a_1 + 3a_2 = 5a_1 - 5a_2$$

$$8a_2 = 2a_1 \Rightarrow \frac{a_1}{a_2} = 4$$

Since width $W \propto$ Intensity $\propto a^2$:

$$\frac{W_1}{W_2} = \frac{I_1}{I_2} = \frac{a_1^2}{a_2^2} = \frac{16}{1}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{W_1}{W_2} = 16 : 1}$$

*[Note: Give ½ mark if the student just writes Intensity $\propto$ width.]*

---

**OR**

**Solution:**

**(a) Diffraction Pattern from a Single Slit:**

[Diagram: A single slit of width $a$ is illuminated by a monochromatic source S. Parallel rays from the slit converge on a screen. Point C is the central maximum ($\theta = 0$). Point P is at angle $\theta$ from C. The path difference between rays from the two edges L and N of the slit is $NQ = a\sin\theta \approx a\theta$. Points $M_1$ and $M_2$ are intermediate points in the slit.]

The path difference between the two edges of the slit:

$$\text{NP} - \text{LP} = NQ = a\sin\theta \approx a\theta$$

- At the **central point C** ($\theta = 0$): all parts of the slit contribute in phase → **central maximum**.

- At points where $\theta \approx \dfrac{n\lambda}{a}$ (for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$): net contribution is almost zero → **minima**.

- At points where $\theta \approx \dfrac{(2n+1)\lambda}{2a}$ (for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$): non-zero contribution → **secondary maxima** of decreasing intensity.

**Conditions:**

- **Secondary minima:** $a\sin\theta = n\lambda$ → $\theta \approx \dfrac{n\lambda}{a}$

- **Secondary maxima:** $a\sin\theta = (2n+1)\dfrac{\lambda}{2}$ → $\theta \approx \dfrac{(2n+1)\lambda}{2a}$

*[Note: Also accept alternative correct diagram with appropriate explanation.]*

---

**(b) Separation between positions of first maxima:**

**Angular width** of the secondary maxima:

$$\approx 2(2n+1)\frac{\lambda}{a}$$

**Linear width** of secondary maximum:

$$= \left[(2n+1)\frac{\lambda}{a}\right] D$$

For the **first secondary maximum** ($n = 1$), the linear position on screen:

$$x = \frac{3\lambda D}{2a}$$

The **separation** between the first maxima of the two wavelengths ($\lambda_1 = 590$ nm, $\lambda_2 = 596$ nm):

$$\Delta x = \frac{3(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)}{a} \times D$$

$$= \frac{3(596 - 590) \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} \times 1.5 \ m$$

$$= \frac{3 \times 6 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} \times 1.5$$

$$= \frac{18 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} \times 1.5 = 9 \times 10^{-3} \times 1.5$$

$$\boxed{\Delta x = 13.5 \times 10^{-3} \ m = 13.5 \ mm}$$

### Q30.
**(a)** Deduce an expression for the frequency of revolution of a charged particle in a magnetic field and show that it is independent of velocity or energy of the particle.

**(b)** Draw a schematic sketch of a cyclotron. Explain, giving the essential details of its construction, how it is used to accelerate the charged particles.

**OR**

**(a)** Draw a labelled diagram of a moving coil galvanometer. Describe briefly its principle and working.

**(b)** Answer the following:
(i) Why is it necessary to introduce a cylindrical soft iron core inside the coil of a galvanometer?
(ii) Increasing the current sensitivity of a galvanometer may not necessarily increase its voltage sensitivity. Explain, giving reason.

**Answer (Main Question):**

**Solution:**

**(a) Frequency of Revolution of a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field:**

When a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ moves with a velocity $v$ in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$, it experiences a force $\vec{F}$ where:

$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

This magnetic force provides the centripetal force:

$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB_\perp$$

$$\therefore r = \frac{mv}{qB_\perp}$$

**Frequency of revolution:**

$$\nu = \frac{v}{2\pi r} = \frac{v}{2\pi \cdot \dfrac{mv}{qB_\perp}} = \frac{qB_\perp}{2\pi m}$$

$$\boxed{\nu = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}}$$

This expression shows that $\nu$ is **independent of the velocity $v$** (or the energy) of the particle — it depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio and the magnetic field strength.

---

**(b) Cyclotron — Sketch, Construction, and Working:**

[Diagram: A top-view schematic of a cyclotron showing:
- Two hollow D-shaped semi-circular metal containers ($D_1$ and $D_2$, the "dees") facing each other with a small gap between them
- Charged particles spiralling outward from the centre
- An oscillator connected across the gap between the dees
- Magnetic field directed perpendicular to the plane (into the page, shown by dots)
- An exit port/deflection plate at the outer edge
- The overall circular arrangement enclosed in a vacuum chamber]

**Construction:**

The cyclotron consists of two hollow semi-circular disc-like metal containers, $D_1$ and $D_2$, called **dees**. It uses crossed electric and magnetic fields:

- A strong **uniform magnetic field** $\vec{B}$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the dees.
- The electric field is provided by an **oscillator of adjustable frequency**, connected across the gap between the dees.

*[Note: Award this mark even if the student labels the diagram properly without writing the details of the construction.]*

**Working:**

In a cyclotron, the **frequency of the applied alternating electric field** is adjusted to be equal to the **cyclotron frequency** (frequency of revolution of the charged particles in the magnetic field). This is called the **resonance condition**.

Each time a charged particle crosses the gap between the dees, it is accelerated by the electric field and gains energy. Inside each dee, the magnetic field makes it move in a semicircular path. The radius of the semicircle increases with increasing energy:

$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$

The particles spiral outward and are finally deflected via an **exit slit** by a deflecting plate to hit the target.

---

**OR**

**Solution:**

**(a) Moving Coil Galvanometer:**

[Diagram: A labelled moving coil galvanometer showing:
- A permanent horseshoe magnet with N and S poles
- A cylindrical soft iron core at the centre between the poles
- A rectangular coil wound around the core, suspended by a phosphor-bronze strip
- A pointer attached to the coil
- A calibrated scale
- A spring providing restoring torque
- Uniform radial magnetic field in the gap]

**Principle and Working:**

A current-carrying coil placed in a uniform magnetic field experiences a **torque**.

Consider a rectangular coil with:
- Number of turns = $N$
- Area of cross-section = $l \times b = A$
- Magnetic field intensity = $B$
- Current through the coil = $I$

**Deflecting torque:**

$$\tau_{deflecting} = BIl \times b = BIA$$

For $N$ turns:

$$\tau = NBIA$$

**Restoring torque** (due to the spring):

$$\tau_{restoring} = k\theta$$

where $k$ = restoring torque per unit twist (torsional constant).

At equilibrium:

$$NBIA = k\theta$$

$$\therefore I = \left(\frac{k}{NBA}\right)\theta$$

$$\therefore I \propto \theta$$

The **deflection of the coil is proportional to the current** flowing through it.

---

**(b)**

**(i) Need for Cylindrical Soft Iron Core:**

The soft iron core:
- Makes the magnetic field **radial** (always parallel to the plane of the coil), ensuring a linear scale.
- **Increases the strength** of the magnetic field, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the galvanometer.

*[Note: Award this one mark even if the student writes just one of the two reasons given above.]*

---

**(ii) Current Sensitivity vs. Voltage Sensitivity:**

**Current sensitivity:**

$$S_I = \frac{\theta}{I} = \frac{NBA}{k}$$

**Voltage sensitivity:**

$$S_V = \frac{\theta}{V} = \frac{\theta}{IR} = \frac{NBA}{kR}$$

If we increase current sensitivity by, say, increasing $N$, the resistance $R$ of the coil also increases (since more turns means more wire). Since $S_V = \dfrac{S_I}{R}$, the increase in $R$ may offset the increase in $S_I$, leaving $S_V$ unchanged or even decreased.

Therefore, **increasing the current sensitivity may not necessarily increase the voltage sensitivity**.
