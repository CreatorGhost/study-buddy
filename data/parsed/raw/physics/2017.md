### Q1.
Nichrome and copper wires of same length and same radius are connected in series. Current $I$ is passed through them. Which wire gets heated up more? Justify your answer.

**Answer:** Nichrome wire gets heated up more.

**Solution:**
Heat dissipated in a wire is given by:
$$H = I^2 R t = I^2 \frac{\rho l}{A} \times t \qquad \left(\because R = \frac{\rho l}{A}\right)$$

For the same current $I$, length $l$, and area of cross-section $A$, heat depends on resistivity:
$$H \propto \rho$$

Since $\rho_{\text{nichrome}} > \rho_{\text{copper}}$, we have:
$$H_{\text{nichrome}} > H_{\text{copper}}$$

Therefore, the **nichrome wire** gets heated up more.

### Q2.
Do electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum?

**Answer:** Yes.

**Solution:**
Yes, electromagnetic waves (EMW) carry energy $E$ and momentum $P$, given by:
$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
$$P = mc$$

where $c$ is the speed of the EM wave in vacuum and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the EM wave.

### Q3.
How does the angle of minimum deviation of a glass prism vary, if the incident violet light is replaced by red light? Give reason.

**Answer:** The angle of minimum deviation **decreases** when violet light is replaced by red light.

**Solution:**
Since $\lambda_{\text{red}} > \lambda_{\text{violet}}$ and we know $\lambda \propto \dfrac{1}{\mu}$, it follows that:
$$\mu_{\text{red}} < \mu_{\text{violet}}$$

For minimum deviation, the refractive index is related by:
$$\mu = \frac{\sin\!\left(\dfrac{\delta_m + A}{2}\right)}{\sin\!\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)}$$

Since $\mu_{\text{red}} < \mu_{\text{violet}}$, we conclude:
$$(\delta_m)_{\text{violet}} > (\delta_m)_{\text{red}}$$

Therefore, the angle of minimum deviation **decreases** when violet light is replaced by red light.

### Q4.
Name the phenomenon which shows the quantum nature of electromagnetic radiation.

**Answer:** **Photoelectric effect**

**Solution:**
The **"Photoelectric effect"** shows the quantum nature of electromagnetic radiation. In this phenomenon, light behaves as discrete packets of energy (photons) rather than as continuous waves, which cannot be explained by classical wave theory.

### Q5.
Predict the polarity of the capacitor in the situation described below:

[Diagram: Two bar magnets with N poles facing each other (left magnet moving right, right magnet moving left) with a capacitor (plates A on top, B on bottom) placed between them in the gap.]

**Answer:** Plate A is positive (+) and Plate B is negative (−).

**Solution:**
According to **Lenz's law**, the polarity of the induced emf is such that it opposes the cause of its production. Applying Lenz's law to the given situation, the polarity of the capacitor is:
- Plate **A** → **positive (+)**
- Plate **B** → **negative (−)**

[Diagram: Same setup as above with the capacitor now labelled with + on plate A (top) and − on plate B (bottom).]

### Q6.
Draw the intensity pattern for single slit diffraction and double slit interference. Hence, state two differences between interference and diffraction patterns.

**OR**

Unpolarised light is passed through a polaroid $P_1$. When this polarised beam passes through another polaroid $P_2$ and if the pass axis of $P_2$ makes angle $\theta$ with the pass axis of $P_1$, then write the expression for the polarised beam passing through $P_2$. Draw a plot showing the variation of intensity when $\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\pi$.

**Solution (Main Question):**

**Intensity distribution graph for Young's Double Slit Experiment (YDSE):**

[Diagram: Intensity vs position graph showing equal-width, equal-height bright fringes symmetrically placed on either side of a central bright fringe. Positions labelled $B_2, D_2, B_1, D_1, O, D_1, B_1, D_2, B_2, D_3$ along the horizontal axis.]

**Intensity distribution graph for Single Slit Diffraction:**

[Diagram: Intensity vs path difference ($d\sin\theta$) graph showing a tall central maximum flanked by successively diminishing secondary maxima. Minima occur at $-3\lambda, -2\lambda, -\lambda, \lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda$.]

**Differences between Interference and Diffraction patterns:**

| Interference | Diffraction |
|---|---|
| All bright and dark fringes are of equal width. | The central bright fringe has double the width of secondary maxima and minima. |
| All bright fringes are of the same intensity. | The central fringe is the brightest; intensity of secondary maxima decreases with increasing order on either side of central maxima. |

---

**Solution (OR):**

[Diagram: Unpolarised light of intensity $I_0$ passes through polaroid $P_1$ giving polarised light of intensity $I_1 = \dfrac{I_0}{2}$, then passes through polaroid $P_2$ (pass axis at angle $\theta$) giving intensity $I_2 = I_1\cos^2\theta = \dfrac{I_0\cos^2\theta}{2}$.]

According to the **Law of Malus**, when a beam of completely plane polarised light is incident on an analyser, the resultant intensity of transmitted light varies directly as the square of the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between the planes of the analyser and polariser:
$$I \propto \cos^2\theta \implies I = I_0\cos^2\theta$$

- When polariser and analyser are parallel: $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$, so $\cos\theta = \pm 1$, giving $I = I_0$
- When $\theta = 90°$: $\cos\theta = 0$, giving $I = 0$

For unpolarised light, the average value of $\cos^2\theta$ over a full cycle is:
$$[\cos^2\theta]_{\text{av}} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\cos^2\theta\, d\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{(1+\cos 2\theta)}{2}\,d\theta$$
$$= \frac{1}{2\pi \times 2}\left[\theta + \frac{\sin 2\theta}{2}\right]_0^{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Using the Law of Malus:
$$I = I_0\cos^2\theta \implies I = I_0 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}I_0$$

**Graph of intensity vs $\theta$:**

[Diagram: Graph of $I$ vs $\theta$ showing $I$ starting at $I_0/2$ at $\theta = 0$, decreasing to 0 at $\theta = \pi/2$, rising back to $I_0/2$ at $\theta = \pi$, with the curve following a $\cos^2\theta$ shape.]

### Q7.
Identify the electromagnetic waves whose wavelengths vary as:

(a) $10^{-12}\ \text{m} < \lambda < 10^{-8}\ \text{m}$

(b) $10^{-3}\ \text{m} < \lambda < 10^{-1}\ \text{m}$

Write one use for each.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**(a) X-rays**
- Wavelength range: $10^{-12}\ \text{m}$ to $10^{-8}\ \text{m}$
- **Use:** X-rays are used in surgery to detect fractures, damaged organs, and stones in the body.

**(b) Microwaves** *(Note: The solution document states "Gamma Rays" but the wavelength range $10^{-3}$ m to $10^{-1}$ m corresponds to microwaves)*
- Wavelength range: $10^{-3}\ \text{m}$ to $10^{-1}\ \text{m}$
- **Use:** Microwaves are used in radar systems and microwave ovens.

*(As given in the solution document: Gamma Rays — used in radiotherapy for the treatment of tumours and cancer.)*

### Q8.
Find the condition under which the charged particles moving with different speeds in the presence of electric and magnetic field vectors can be used to select charged particles of a particular speed.

**Solution:**
A **velocity selector** uses both electric and magnetic fields. For a charged particle to pass through undeflected, the electric force must balance the magnetic force:
$$qE = qvB$$
$$\therefore v = \frac{E}{B}$$

Only particles with speed $v = \dfrac{E}{B}$ will pass through undeflected, regardless of their charge. This is the required condition.

The electric field $\vec{E}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}$ must be **perpendicular to each other** and to the direction of motion of the particles.

---

### Q9.
A 12.5 eV electron beam is used to excite a gaseous hydrogen atom at room temperature. Determine the wavelengths and the corresponding series of the lines emitted.

**Solution:**
The energy levels of gaseous hydrogen at room temperature are:
$$E_1 = -13.6\ \text{eV}, \quad E_2 = -3.4\ \text{eV}, \quad E_3 = -1.51\ \text{eV}, \quad E_4 = -0.85\ \text{eV}$$

Checking transitions from ground state:
$$E_3 - E_1 = -1.51 - (-13.6) = 12.09\ \text{eV}$$
$$E_4 - E_1 = -0.85 - (-13.6) = 12.75\ \text{eV}$$

Both values are less than 12.5 eV, so the hydrogen atom is excited up to the **$n = 4$ energy level**.

The possible transitions and resulting spectral series are:

**Lyman Series** (transitions to $n = 1$):
$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left[\frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right]$$

For first member ($n = 2$):
$$\frac{1}{\lambda_1} = R\left[\frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2}\right] = 1.097 \times 10^7\left[\frac{4-1}{4}\right]$$
$$\Rightarrow \lambda_1 \approx 1.22 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m} = 122\ \text{nm}$$

**Balmer Series** (transitions to $n = 2$):
$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left[\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right]$$

For first member ($n = 3$):
$$\frac{1}{\lambda_1} = R\left[\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2}\right] = 1.097 \times 10^7\left[\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9}\right]$$
$$\Rightarrow \lambda_1 = 6.56 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{m} = 656\ \text{nm}$$

### Q10.
Write two properties of a material suitable for making (a) a permanent magnet, and (b) an electromagnet.

**Solution:**

**(a) Permanent Magnet** — Two suitable properties:
1. **High coercivity** (requires a large reverse field to demagnetise)
2. **High retentivity** and high hysteresis loss

**(b) Electromagnet** — Two suitable properties:
1. **High permeability** (gets strongly magnetised in the presence of a magnetic field)
2. **Low coercivity** (can be easily demagnetised)

### Q11.
(a) The potential difference applied across a given resistor is altered so that the heat produced per second increases by a factor of 9. By what factor does the applied potential difference change?

(b) In the figure shown, an ammeter A and a resistor of $4\ \Omega$ are connected to the terminals of the source. The emf of the source is 12 V having an internal resistance of $2\ \Omega$. Calculate the voltmeter and ammeter readings.

[Diagram: Circuit with a 12 V battery (internal resistance $2\ \Omega$), a voltmeter V connected across the battery terminals, an ammeter A in series, and an external resistor $R = 4\ \Omega$.]

**Solution:**

**(a)**
Heat dissipated per unit time:
$$H = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

Let initial resistance $R = 6\ \Omega$ (as used in solution). Initially:
$$H = \frac{(12)^2}{6} = 24\ \text{J/s}$$

New heat dissipated per unit time:
$$H' = H \times 9 = 216\ \text{J/s}$$

Let the new voltage be $V'$:
$$\frac{(V')^2}{R} = 216$$
$$(V')^2 = 216 \times 6 = 1296$$
$$V' = 36\ \text{V}$$

The applied potential difference changes by a factor of:
$$\frac{V'}{V} = \frac{36}{12} = \boxed{3}$$

**(b)**
Given:
- EMF: $\mathcal{E} = 12\ \text{V}$
- Internal resistance: $r = 2\ \Omega$
- External resistance: $R = 4\ \Omega$

Current through the circuit:
$$I = \frac{\mathcal{E}}{R + r} = \frac{12}{4 + 2} = \frac{12}{6} = 2\ \text{A}$$

**Ammeter reading = 2 A**

Terminal voltage (voltmeter reading):
$$V = \mathcal{E} - Ir = 12 - 2 \times 2 = 12 - 4 = 8\ \text{V}$$

**Voltmeter reading = 8 V**

### Q12.
(a) How is amplitude modulation achieved?

(b) The frequencies of two side bands in an AM wave are 640 kHz and 660 kHz respectively. Find the frequencies of the carrier and modulating signal. What is the bandwidth required for amplitude modulation?

**Solution:**

**(a) Amplitude Modulation:**

In AM, the modulating wave is superimposed on a carrier wave such that the **frequency** of the modulated wave remains the same as the carrier, but its **amplitude** varies in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating wave.

[Diagram: Block diagram — Modulating wave $m(t)$ and Carrier wave $c(t)$ fed into a Square Law Device → output $x(t)$ → Band Pass Filter → AM wave output.]

Let the modulating signal be:
$$m(t) = A_m \sin\omega_m t$$
and the carrier wave:
$$c(t) = A_c \sin\omega_c t$$

When added, the resultant wave is:
$$x(t) = A_m \sin\omega_m t + A_c \sin\omega_c t = A_c\left(1 + \frac{A_m}{A_c}\sin\omega_m t\right)\sin\omega_c t$$

This can be written as:
$$x(t) = A_c\sin\omega_c t + \mu A_c \sin\omega_m t \times \sin\omega_c t$$

where $\mu = \dfrac{A_m}{A_c}$ is the **modulation index** (in practice $\mu \leq 1$ to avoid distortion).

Using the trigonometric identity $\sin A \sin B = \dfrac{1}{2}[\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B)]$:

$$\boxed{x(t) = A_c\sin\omega_c t + \frac{\mu A_c}{2}\cos(\omega_c - \omega_m)t - \frac{\mu A_c}{2}\cos(\omega_c + \omega_m)t}$$

**(b)**
Given:
$$\omega_c + \omega_m = 660\ \text{kHz} \quad \cdots(1)$$
$$\omega_c - \omega_m = 640\ \text{kHz} \quad \cdots(2)$$

Adding (1) and (2):
$$2\omega_c = 1300\ \text{kHz} \implies \omega_c = 650\ \text{kHz}$$

Since $\omega_c = 2\pi f_c$:
$$\boxed{f_c = \frac{650}{2\pi}\ \text{kHz}}$$

Subtracting (2) from (1):
$$\omega_m = 660 - 650 = 10\ \text{kHz}$$

Since $\omega_m = 2\pi f_m$:
$$\boxed{f_m = \frac{10}{2\pi}\ \text{kHz}}$$

**Bandwidth required for amplitude modulation:**
$$\text{Bandwidth} = (f_c + f_m) - (f_c - f_m) = 2f_m = 2 \times \frac{10}{2\pi}\ \text{kHz}$$

### Q13.
(a) In the following diagram, is the junction diode forward biased or reverse biased?

[Diagram: A diode with anode connected to ground (through a wire) and cathode connected to $+5\ \text{V}$ through a resistor.]

(b) Draw the circuit diagram of a full wave rectifier and state how it works.

**Solution:**

**(a)**
The voltage at the **P side** (anode) is less than the voltage at the **N side** (cathode), so the diode is in **"Reverse Bias"**.

**(b) Full Wave Rectifier:**

[Diagram: Circuit with centre-tapped transformer having secondary coil with centre tap B. Diode $D_1$ connected to top terminal $S_1$ and diode $D_2$ connected to bottom terminal $S_2$. Both diodes connect to load resistance $R_L$ with output taken between point A (+) and centre tap B (−).]

**For positive half cycle:**
[Diagram: During positive half cycle, $D_1$ is forward biased, $D_2$ is reverse biased. Current flows through $D_1 \to R_L$.]

**For negative half cycle:**
[Diagram: During negative half cycle, $D_1$ is reverse biased, $D_2$ is forward biased. Current flows through $D_2 \to R_L$ in the same direction.]

**Input and output waveforms:**

[Diagram: (i) Sinusoidal AC input waveform at terminal A. (ii) Inverted sinusoidal waveform at terminal B. (iii) Full-wave rectified output across $R_L$ — both half cycles appear as positive humps, alternately due to $D_1$ and $D_2$.]

**Working:**
- During the **positive half cycle** of the input AC, diode $D_1$ is **forward biased** and $D_2$ is **reverse biased**. Forward current flows through diode $D_1$.
- During the **negative half cycle** of the input AC, diode $D_1$ is **reverse biased** and diode $D_2$ is **forward biased**. Current flows through diode $D_2$.
- During **both halves**, current flows in the **same direction** through the load $R_L$.

A full wave rectifier is used to convert AC into DC.

### Q14.
Using the photon picture of light, show how Einstein's photoelectric equation can be established. Write two features of photoelectric effect which cannot be explained by wave theory.

**Solution:**

**Einstein's Photoelectric Equation:**

When a photon of energy $h\nu$ falls on a metal surface, the energy of the photon is absorbed by the electrons and used in the following two ways:

(i) A part of the energy is used to overcome the surface barrier and come out of the metal surface. This part is called the **work function**:
$$\phi_0 = h\nu_0$$

(ii) The remaining part of the energy gives velocity $v$ to the emitted photoelectron, equal to its maximum kinetic energy:
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^2$$

(iii) By the **law of conservation of energy**:
$$h\nu = \phi_0 + \frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^2 = h\nu_0 + \frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^2$$

$$\therefore \frac{1}{2}mv_{\max}^2 = k_{\max} = h(\nu - \nu_0) = h\nu - \phi_0$$

$$\boxed{k_{\max} = h\nu - \phi_0}$$

This is called **Einstein's Photoelectric Equation**.

**Two features that cannot be explained by wave theory:**
1. **Instantaneous emission**: Photoelectric emission is instantaneous (no time lag) even for low-intensity light — wave theory predicts that sufficient energy must accumulate over time.
2. **Existence of threshold frequency**: Below a certain frequency $\nu_0$, no emission occurs regardless of intensity — wave theory predicts emission should occur at any frequency if intensity is high enough.

### Q15.
(a) Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a water surface. If $\mu$ for water is 1.33, find the wavelength, frequency and speed of the refracted light.

(b) A double convex lens is made of a glass of refractive index 1.55, with both faces of the same radius of curvature. Find the radius of curvature required, if the focal length is 20 cm.

**Solution:**

**(a)**
Given:
- $\lambda_1 = 589\ \text{nm} = 589 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{m}$
- Speed of light in air: $v_1 = 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$
- $\mu_w = 1.33$, $\mu_a = 1$

**Wavelength of refracted light:**
$$\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} = \frac{\mu_w}{\mu_a}$$
$$\lambda_2 = \frac{589 \times 10^{-9}}{1.33} = 442.85 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{m} = \boxed{442.85\ \text{nm}}$$

**Speed of refracted light:**
$$\frac{\mu_w}{\mu_a} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$$
$$v_2 = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.33} = 2.25 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$$

**Frequency of refracted light** (frequency does not change on refraction):
$$f = \frac{v_2}{\lambda_2} = \frac{2.25 \times 10^8}{442.85 \times 10^{-9}} = \boxed{5.08 \times 10^{14}\ \text{Hz}}$$

**(b)**

[Diagram: Double convex lens with $R_1$ and $R_2$ labelled on left and right faces respectively.]

Given:
- $_{a}\mu_g = 1.55$
- For double convex lens: $R_1 = R$, $R_2 = -R$ (both faces have same radius of curvature; for double convex lens, one radius is positive and the other negative)
- $f = +20\ \text{cm}$

Using the **Lens Maker's Formula**:
$$\frac{1}{f} = (_{a}\mu_g - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$$
$$\frac{1}{20} = (1.55 - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{R}\right)$$
$$\frac{1}{20} = 0.55 \times \frac{2}{R}$$
$$R = 0.55 \times 2 \times 20 = \boxed{22\ \text{cm}}$$

### Q16.
Define mutual inductance between a pair of coils. Derive an expression for the mutual inductance of two long coaxial solenoids of same length wound one over the other.

**OR**

Define self-inductance of a coil. Obtain the expression for the energy stored in an inductor $L$ connected across a source of emf.

**Solution (Main Question):**

**Mutual Inductance:** The phenomenon according to which an opposing emf is produced as a result of a change in current or magnetic flux linked with a neighbouring coil.

**Mutual inductance of two long coaxial solenoids:**

[Diagram: Two coaxial solenoids $S_1$ (outer, longer) and $S_2$ (inner, shorter) of the same length $\ell$ wound one over the other.]

Let:
- $n_1$ = number of turns per unit length of $S_1$
- $n_2$ = number of turns per unit length of $S_2$
- $I_1$ = current passed through $S_1$
- $\phi_{21}$ = flux linked with $S_2$ due to current in $S_1$

$$\phi_{21} \propto I_1 \implies \phi_{21} = M_{21} I_1$$

where $M_{21}$ is the coefficient of mutual induction.

When current flows through $S_1$, the magnetic field produced inside $S_1$ is:
$$B_1 = \mu_0 n_1 I_1$$

Magnetic flux linked with **each turn** of $S_2$ = $B_1 \times A$ (area of cross-section of $S_1$)

Total magnetic flux linked with solenoid $S_2$:
$$\phi_{21} = B_1 \times A \times n_2\ell = \mu_0 n_1 I_1 \times A \times n_2 \ell$$
$$\phi_{21} = \mu_0 n_1 n_2 A I_1 \ell$$
$$\therefore M_{21} = \mu_0 n_1 n_2 A\ell \quad \cdots(i)$$

Similarly, the mutual inductance when current passes through $S_2$:
$$M_{12} = \mu_0 n_1 n_2 A\ell$$
$$M_{12} = M_{21} = M \text{ (say)}$$

Hence, the **coefficient of mutual induction** between the two long solenoids:
$$\boxed{M = \mu_0 n_1 n_2 A\ell}$$

Writing in terms of total number of turns $N_1 = n_1\ell$ and $N_2 = n_2\ell$:
$$M = \mu_0\left(\frac{N_1}{\ell}\right)\left(\frac{N_2}{\ell}\right)\pi r_1^2 \times \ell = \frac{\mu_0 N_1 N_2 A}{\ell}$$

If a core of magnetic material of relative permeability $\mu_r$ is placed:
$$M = \frac{\mu_0 \mu_r N_1 N_2 A}{\ell}$$

---

**Solution (OR):**

**Self-Inductance:** Self-inductance is the property of a coil by virtue of which the coil opposes any change in the strength of current flowing through it, by inducing an emf in itself. The induced emf is also called **back emf**.

Self-induction is also called the **inertia of electricity**.

[Diagram: Inductor $L$ connected in series with a resistance $R$ and a battery $B$.]

**Expression for energy stored in an inductor:**

Magnetic field at any point inside a solenoid:
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{\ell} \quad \cdots(i)$$

Magnetic flux through each turn:
$$\phi = B \times A = \left(\mu_0\frac{N}{\ell}I\right)A$$

Total magnetic flux linked with solenoid:
$$N\phi = \mu_0\frac{N}{\ell}IA \times N \quad \cdots(ii)$$

If $L$ is the coefficient of self-inductance:
$$N\phi = LI \quad \cdots(iii)$$

From (ii) and (iii):
$$L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{\ell} \quad \cdots(iv)$$

The magnitude of induced back emf:
$$e = L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

Multiplying both sides by $I$:
$$eI\,dt = LI\,dI \quad \cdots(v)$$

Since $I = \dfrac{dq}{dt}$, we have $I\,dt = dq$.

Work done:
$$dW = e \times dq = eI\,dt \quad \cdots(vi)$$

From (v) and (vi):
$$dW = LI\,dI \quad \cdots(vii)$$

Total work done in increasing current from $0$ to $I_0$:
$$\int_0^W dW = \int_0^{I_0} LI\,dI$$
$$W = \frac{1}{2}LI_0^2$$

This work done is stored as **potential energy** in the magnetic field of the inductor:
$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{2}LI_0^2}$$

### Q17.
(a) Write the principle of working of a metre bridge.

(b) In a metre bridge, the balance point is found at a distance $l_1$ with resistances $R$ and $S$ as shown in the figure.

[Diagram: Metre bridge circuit with resistance $R$ and $S$ in the arms, galvanometer $G$ connected at jockey position $l_1$ from end A, battery connected at ends A and C.]

An unknown resistance $X$ is now connected in parallel to the resistance $S$ and the balance point is found at a distance $l_2$. Obtain a formula for $X$ in terms of $l_1$, $l_2$ and $S$.

**Solution:**

**(a) Principle:**
The metre bridge is constructed on the principle of the **balanced Wheatstone bridge**.

When a Wheatstone bridge is balanced:
$$\frac{P}{Q} = \frac{R}{S}$$

At the balancing condition of the metre bridge:
$$\frac{P}{Q} = \frac{R}{S} \implies \frac{l}{100 - l} = \frac{R}{S} \implies S = \frac{100 - l}{l} \times R$$

[Diagram: Full metre bridge circuit showing resistance box RB, resistance wire, points A, B, C, D, galvanometer G, rheostat Rh, cell, and key K. Length $l$ cm and $(100-l)$ cm marked on the bridge wire.]

**(b)**

For the **first balanced bridge** position:
$$\frac{R}{S} = \frac{l_1}{100 - l_1} \quad \cdots(i)$$

When $X$ is connected in parallel with $S$, the equivalent resistance is:
$$S_{\text{eq}} = \frac{XS}{X + S}$$

For the **second balanced bridge** position:
$$\frac{R}{S_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{l_2}{100 - l_2}$$
$$\frac{R(X + S)}{XS} = \frac{l_2}{100 - l_2} \quad \cdots(ii)$$

From (i): $\dfrac{R}{S} = \dfrac{l_1}{100 - l_1}$

Substituting into (ii):
$$\frac{(X + S)}{X} \times \frac{l_1}{100 - l_1} = \frac{l_2}{100 - l_2}$$
$$\frac{X + S}{X} = \frac{l_2(100 - l_1)}{(100 - l_2)l_1}$$

Solving for $X$:
$$\boxed{X = \frac{S \cdot l_1(100 - l_2)}{l_2(100 - l_1) - l_1(100 - l_2)}}$$

*(Simplifying from the relation $\dfrac{X+S}{X} = \dfrac{l_2(100-l_1)}{(100-l_2)l_1}$)*

### Q19.
(a) Write the functions of the three segments of a transistor.

(b) The figure shows the input waveforms A and B for an 'AND' gate. Draw the output waveform and write the truth table for this logic gate.

[Diagram: Input waveforms A and B plotted against time $t_1$ through $t_8$. A is HIGH from $t_2$ to $t_6$ and $t_7$ to $t_8$; B is HIGH from $t_3$ to $t_7$.]

**Solution:**

**(a) Three segments of a transistor:**

The three segments are: **Emitter (E)**, **Base (B)**, and **Collector (C)**.

- **Emitter:** It is of **moderate size and heavily doped**. It supplies a large number of majority carriers for the current flow through the transistor.
- **Base:** It is the **control segment** and is very **thin and lightly doped**.
- **Collector:** It is the segment that **collects the major portion of majority carriers** supplied by the emitter. It is **moderately doped and large in size** compared to the emitter.

**(b) AND Gate:**

The Boolean expression for an AND gate: $Y = A \cdot B$

The output $Y = 1$ **only when both inputs A and B are 1**.

**Output waveform:**

[Diagram: Output $X$ (= $Y$) is HIGH only in the interval where both A and B are simultaneously HIGH — i.e., from $t_3$ to $t_6$ and briefly at $t_7$ (depending on exact timing). Output is LOW otherwise.]

**Truth Table for AND gate:**

| Input A | Input B | Output $Y = A \cdot B$ |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

### Q20.
(a) Draw a ray diagram depicting the formation of the image by an astronomical telescope in normal adjustment.

(b) You are given the following three lenses. Which two lenses will you use as an eyepiece and as an objective to construct an astronomical telescope? Give reason.

| Lenses | Power (D) | Aperture (cm) |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| $L_1$ | 3 | 8 |
| $L_2$ | 6 | 1 |
| $L_3$ | 10 | 1 |

**Solution:**

**(a) Ray diagram of Astronomical Telescope (Normal Adjustment):**

[Diagram: Parallel rays from a distant object enter the objective lens (large aperture, long focal length $f_o$). They converge to form a real, inverted image at the focal plane of the objective (which coincides with the focal plane of the eyepiece). The eyepiece (small, high-power lens) then forms the final image at infinity. Points labelled: $O$ (objective), Eye lens (eyepiece), $C_1$, $C_2$ (centres), $F_o$, $F_e$ (focal points), $A'$, $B'$ (intermediate image). $f_o$ and $f_e$ marked.)]

**(b)**
- **Objective lens:** $L_1$ (Power = 3 D, Aperture = 8 cm)
  - **Reason:** $L_1$ has the **largest aperture (8 cm)**, giving it high resolving power and the ability to gather more light. The objective must have a large aperture and large focal length (low power).
- **Eyepiece:** $L_3$ (Power = 10 D, Aperture = 1 cm)
  - **Reason:** $L_3$ has the **highest power (10 D)**, i.e., shortest focal length, which gives greater magnification.

### Q21.
(a) State Biot–Savart law and express this law in the vector form.

(b) Two identical circular coils, P and Q, each of radius $R$, carrying currents $1\ \text{A}$ and $\sqrt{3}\ \text{A}$ respectively, are placed concentrically and perpendicular to each other lying in the XY and YZ planes. Find the magnitude and direction of the net magnetic field at the centre of the coils.

**Solution:**

**(a) Biot–Savart's Law:**

This law states that the magnetic field $d\vec{B}$ at a point P due to a small current element $Id\vec{l}$ of a current-carrying conductor is:

(i) Directly proportional to the current element: $dB \propto Id\vec{l}$
(ii) Directly proportional to $\sin\theta$: $dB \propto \sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $d\vec{l}$ and $\vec{r}$
(iii) Inversely proportional to the square of the distance: $dB \propto \dfrac{1}{r^2}$

[Diagram: Current element $Id\vec{l}$ at angle $\theta$ to the position vector $\vec{r}$ pointing to field point P.]

Combining:
$$dB \propto \frac{Id\vec{l}\sin\theta}{r^2} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{Id\vec{l}\sin\theta}{r^2}$$

where $\dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} = 10^{-7}$ T·m/A for free space.

**Vector form:**
$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{Id\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{|r|^2} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{Id\vec{l} \times \vec{r}}{r^3}$$

**(b)**

Given: $I_1 = 1\ \text{A}$ (coil P in XY plane), $I_2 = \sqrt{3}\ \text{A}$ (coil Q in YZ plane)

[Diagram: Two perpendicular coils P (in XY plane) and Q (in YZ plane) with radius R, placed concentrically. $B_P$ points along the Z-axis and $B_Q$ points along the X-axis.]

Magnetic field due to coil P at its centre (along Z-axis):
$$B_P = \frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2R} = \frac{\mu_0 \times 1}{2R}$$

Magnetic field due to coil Q at its centre (along X-axis):
$$B_Q = \frac{\mu_0 I_2}{2R} = \frac{\mu_0\sqrt{3}}{2R}$$

Since $\vec{B}_P \perp \vec{B}_Q$, the resultant magnetic field:
$$B = \sqrt{B_P^2 + B_Q^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\mu_0 I_1}{2R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\mu_0 I_2}{2R}\right)^2}$$
$$= \sqrt{\left(\frac{\mu_0}{2R}\right)^2(I_1^2 + I_2^2)} = \frac{\mu_0}{2R}\sqrt{1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \frac{\mu_0}{2R}\sqrt{1 + 3}$$
$$= \frac{\mu_0}{2R} \times 2 = \boxed{\frac{\mu_0}{R}}$$

**Direction:** In the **X–Z plane** (at an angle to both X and Z axes).

### Q22.
Two identical parallel plate capacitors A and B are connected to a battery of $V$ volts with the switch S closed. The switch is now opened and the free space between the plates of the capacitors is filled with a dielectric of dielectric constant $K$. Find the ratio of the total electrostatic energy stored in both capacitors **before and after** the introduction of the dielectric.

[Diagram: Battery $E$ connected to two identical parallel-plate capacitors A and B in parallel, with switch S in the circuit.]

**Solution:**

Let $C$ be the capacitance of each capacitor.

**Before** filling with dielectric (switch closed, both charged to voltage $V$):
$$C_{\text{initial}} = A + B = 2C$$

When switch is opened, the **charge on each capacitor is fixed**:
$$Q = CV$$

**After** filling with dielectric (switch is open, so charge is conserved):
$$C_{\text{final}} = KA + KB = K(A + B) = 2KC$$

Energy stored by a capacitor: $U = \dfrac{Q^2}{2C}$

**Energy stored before** introduction of dielectric:
$$U_{\text{initial}} = \frac{Q^2}{2C_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{Q^2}{2(A+B)}$$

**Energy stored after** introduction of dielectric:
$$U_{\text{final}} = \frac{Q^2}{2C_{\text{final}}} = \frac{Q^2}{2K(A+B)}$$

**Ratio of initial to final energy:**
$$\frac{U_{\text{initial}}}{U_{\text{final}}} = \frac{Q^2/[2(A+B)]}{Q^2/[2K(A+B)]} = \boxed{\frac{K}{1}}$$

## Section D — 4 Marks (Value Based Question)

### Q23.
Asha's mother read an article in the newspaper about a disaster that took place at Chernobyl. She could not understand much from the article and asked a few questions from Asha regarding the article. Asha tried to answer her mother's questions based on what she learnt in Class XII Physics.

(a) What was the installation at Chernobyl where the disaster took place? What, according to you, was the cause of this disaster?

(b) Explain the process of release of energy in the installation at Chernobyl.

(c) What, according to you, were the values displayed by Asha and her mother?

**Solution:**

**(a)**
On **April 26, 1986**, the world's worst nuclear accident happened at the **Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant** near Pripyat, Ukraine, in the Soviet Union. An explosion and fire in the **No. 4 reactor** sent radioactivity into the atmosphere.

The cause of the disaster was a **flawed reactor design** combined with **operator error** during a safety test, which led to an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction resulting in a massive explosion.

**(b) Process of Energy Release (Nuclear Fission):**

The installation at Chernobyl was a **nuclear reactor** that used the process of **nuclear fission** to release energy.

In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus (such as $^{235}_{92}\text{U}$) absorbs a slow (thermal) neutron and splits into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments), releasing:
- A large amount of energy (in the form of kinetic energy of fragments and radiation)
- 2–3 neutrons that can trigger further fission reactions (**chain reaction**)

The energy released is due to the **mass defect** — the mass of the products is less than the mass of the reactants, and the difference in mass $\Delta m$ is converted to energy by:
$$E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$$

In a reactor, this chain reaction is **controlled** by control rods (made of boron or cadmium) to maintain a steady rate of energy release.

**(c) Values displayed:**

- **Asha** displayed the values of: **caring, helpfulness, scientific knowledge, and a sense of responsibility** — she used her knowledge of Physics to help her mother understand the incident.
- **Asha's mother** displayed the values of: **curiosity, eagerness to learn**, and **concern for her child's education** — even though she had no scientific background, she was curious enough to seek understanding about the Chernobyl disaster.

## Section E — 5 Marks Each

### Q24.
(a) Derive an expression for the electric field $E$ due to a dipole of length $2a$ at a point distant $r$ from the centre of the dipole on the axial line.

(b) Draw a graph of $E$ versus $r$ for $r \gg a$.

(c) If this dipole were kept in a uniform external electric field $E_0$, diagrammatically represent the position of the dipole in stable and unstable equilibrium and write the expressions for the torque acting on the dipole in both the cases.

**OR**

(a) Use Gauss's theorem to find the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinitely large plane thin sheet with surface charge density $\sigma$.

(b) An infinitely large thin plane sheet has a uniform surface charge density $+\sigma$. Obtain the expression for the amount of work done in bringing a point charge $q$ from infinity to a point, distance $r$, in front of the charged plane sheet.

---

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a) Electric field on the axial line of an electric dipole:**

[Diagram: Electric dipole with $-q$ at point A and $+q$ at point B, separated by $2l$. Point P on the axial line at distance $x$ from centre O. $E_A$ points from P toward A (toward $-q$), $E_B$ points away from B (away from $+q$). Both vectors are along the axis but in opposite directions.]

At point P on the axial line at distance $x$ from centre O:

$$EA = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q}{(x+l)^2} \quad \text{(toward } -q\text{)}$$
$$EB = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{q}{(x-l)^2} \quad \text{(away from } +q\text{)}$$

Since both vectors are collinear but in opposite directions, the resultant:
$$E_P = E_B - E_A = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left[\frac{q}{(x-l)^2} - \frac{q}{(x+l)^2}\right]$$
$$= \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{4qlx}{(x^2 - l^2)^2}$$

Since $p = q \times 2l$:
$$\boxed{E_P = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{2px}{(x^2 - l^2)^2}}$$

In vector form:
$$\vec{E}_P = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{2px}{(x^2 - l^2)^2}\,\hat{p}$$

**For a short dipole** ($2l \ll x$, so $l \ll x$):
$$E_P = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot\frac{2|P|}{x^3} \quad \cdots(i)$$

Direction of $E_P$ is along the direction of $\vec{p}$ (from $-q$ to $+q$ extended). Clearly, $E_P \propto \dfrac{1}{x^3}$.

**(b) Graph of $E$ versus $r$ for $r \gg a$:**

[Diagram: Graph of $E$ vs $r$ showing a curve that starts high at small $r$ and rapidly decreases, following $E \propto \dfrac{1}{r^3}$. The curve is steep and asymptotically approaches zero.]

**(c) Torque on an electric dipole in uniform electric field:**

Consider an electric dipole ($-q$ and $+q$) placed in a uniform external electric field $\vec{E}$. The dipole moment $\vec{P}$ makes an angle $\theta$ with $\vec{E}$.

[Diagram: Dipole at angle $\theta$ in uniform field $E$. Force $+qE$ on $+q$ charge (along $E$), force $-qE$ on $-q$ charge (opposite to $E$). These form a couple.]

The net force is zero, but the two forces constitute a couple. The torque:
$$\tau = \text{Force} \times \text{perpendicular distance} = qE \times 2l\sin\theta$$
$$\tau = (q \times 2l)E\sin\theta = pE\sin\theta$$

In vector notation:
$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$$

**Case I: Stable Equilibrium** ($\theta = 0°$)
$$\tau = pE\sin 0° = 0$$
[Diagram: Dipole aligned parallel to $\vec{E_0}$ — $\vec{p}$ pointing in the same direction as $\vec{E_0}$.]

**Case II:** ($\theta = 90°$)
$$\tau = pE = \tau_{\max}$$

**Case III: Unstable Equilibrium** ($\theta = 180°$)
$$\tau = pE\sin 180° = 0$$
[Diagram: Dipole aligned antiparallel to $\vec{E_0}$ — $\vec{p}$ pointing opposite to $\vec{E_0}$.]

---

**Solution (OR):**

**(a) Electric field due to an infinite plane sheet (using Gauss's Law):**

[Diagram: Infinite plane sheet (surface charge density $\sigma > 0$) with a cylindrical Gaussian surface of cross-sectional area $A$ and length $2r$, straddling the sheet symmetrically. Electric field $\vec{E}$ points outward (perpendicular to sheet) on both flat faces $S_1$ and $S_2$. Curved surface $S_3$ in between. Unit normal $\hat{n}$ shown pointing rightward on the right side.]

Let $\sigma$ be the surface charge density. By symmetry, $\vec{E}$ on either side must be perpendicular to the sheet with the same magnitude at all equidistant points.

Take a cylindrical Gaussian surface of cross-sectional area $A$ and length $2r$:
- Flux through the **curved surface** = 0 (since $\vec{E} \perp \hat{n}$)
- Flux through the **two flat faces** = $EA + EA = 2EA$

Total electric flux:
$$\phi_E = 2EA$$

Total charge enclosed by the cylinder:
$$q = \sigma A$$

By **Gauss's Law**: $\phi E = \dfrac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$

$$2EA = \frac{\sigma A}{\varepsilon_0}$$

$$\boxed{E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}}$$

The field is directed **perpendicular** to the sheet, pointing away from it (for positive $\sigma$).

**(b) Work done in bringing charge $q$ from infinity:**

The potential at the surface of the sheet is $V_0$. At distance $r$ from the sheet:
$$dV = \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{r}$$
$$V_0 - V = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\cdot r$$
$$V = V_0 - \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\cdot r$$

The potential difference between a point at distance $r$ and infinity:

Since $E = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$ is **constant** (independent of distance), the potential varies linearly with distance:
$$V(r) = V_0 - \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\cdot r$$

The work done in bringing charge $q$ from infinity to distance $r$:
$$W = q[V(r) - V(\infty)]$$

Since the electric field of an infinite sheet is constant, the potential difference is not finite in the usual sense. The work done against the electric field:
$$W = qEr = q\cdot\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}\cdot r$$

$$\boxed{W = \frac{q\sigma r}{2\varepsilon_0}}$$

### Q25.
A device 'X' is connected to an ac source $V = V_0\sin\omega t$. The variation of voltage, current and power in one cycle is shown in the following graph:

[Diagram: Graph with $Y$-axis (amplitude) and $X$-axis ($\omega t$ from 0 to $2\pi$). Three curves labelled A, B, C: A is a large sinusoidal curve, B is a smaller sinusoidal curve shifted in phase, C is a smaller curve. Power curve oscillates about zero/positive axis.]

(a) Identify the device 'X'.
(b) Which of the curves A, B and C represent the voltage, current and the power consumed in the circuit? Justify your answer.
(c) How does its impedance vary with frequency of the ac source? Show graphically.
(d) Obtain an expression for the current in the circuit and its phase relation with ac voltage.

**OR**

(a) Draw a labelled diagram of an ac generator. Obtain the expression for the emf induced in the rotating coil of $N$ turns each of cross-sectional area $A$, in the presence of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$.

(b) A horizontal conducting rod 10 m long extending from east to west is falling with a speed 5.0 ms⁻¹ at right angles to the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field, $0.3 \times 10^{-4}$ Wb m⁻². Find the instantaneous value of the emf induced in the rod.

---

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a)**
Device 'X' is a **Capacitor**.

**(b)**
- **Curve A** represents **power consumption** over a full cycle (power oscillates at double frequency, average is zero for ideal capacitor).
- **Curve B** represents **voltage**.
- **Curve C** represents **current**.

**Justification:** In a perfect capacitor, the **current leads the voltage by a phase angle of $\pi/2$**. The power (= $VI$) oscillates and its average over a complete cycle is zero for an ideal capacitor.

**(c) Impedance vs Frequency:**

The impedance (capacitive reactance) of a capacitor:
$$Z = X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}$$
$$X_C \propto \frac{1}{f}$$

[Diagram: Graph of $X_C$ vs $f$ showing a hyperbolic curve — $X_C$ is very large at low frequencies and decreases asymptotically toward zero as frequency increases.]

**(d) Expression for current through capacitor:**

[Diagram: Capacitor $C$ connected to AC source $E$.]

Let the AC source have instantaneous EMF:
$$E = E_0\sin\omega t \quad \cdots(i)$$

Charge on capacitor: $q = CV$, and since $V = E$: $q = CE_0\sin\omega t$

Instantaneous current:
$$I = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{d(CE_0\sin\omega t)}{dt} = CE_0\omega\cos\omega t$$
$$= \frac{E_0}{1/\omega C}\cos\omega t$$
$$= \frac{E_0}{X_C}\cos\omega t = \frac{E_0}{X_C}\sin\!\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \quad \cdots(ii)$$

$I$ is maximum when $\sin\!\left(\omega t + \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1$, giving $I_0 = \dfrac{E_0}{X_C} = \dfrac{E_0}{1/\omega C} = E_0\omega C$.

$$\boxed{I = I_0\sin\!\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} \quad \cdots(iii)$$

From (i) and (iii): **Current leads the voltage by a phase angle of $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$**.

[Diagram: Graph showing voltage $E$ (solid sinusoidal curve) and current $I$ (dashed curve leading $E$ by $\pi/2$).]

---

**Solution (OR):**

**(a) AC Generator:**

[Diagram: Labelled diagram of AC generator with: **Coil** (rectangular armature coil), **Axle** (axis of rotation), **N and S poles** of the permanent magnet, **Slip rings**, **Carbon brushes**, **Alternating emf output** terminals.]

Let the armature coil have $N$ turns, each of cross-sectional area $A$, rotating with angular velocity $\omega$ in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$.

At any instant, the total magnetic flux linked with the coil:
$$\phi = NBA\cos\theta = NBA\cos\omega t$$

By **Faraday's law of EMI**, the induced emf:
$$e = -\frac{d\phi}{dt} = -\frac{d(NBA\cos\omega t)}{dt}$$
$$\frac{d\phi}{dt} = -NBA\omega\sin\omega t$$
$$\therefore e = NBA\omega\sin\omega t$$
$$\boxed{e = e_0\sin\omega t}$$

where $e_0 = NBA\omega$ is the **peak value** of induced emf.

The mechanical energy spent in rotating the coil in the magnetic field appears in the form of **electrical energy**.

[Diagram: Graph of induced emf $e$ vs time, showing sinusoidal variation with peaks at $90°$, $270°$ and zeros at $0°$, $180°$, $360°$. Time axis labelled $T/4$, $T/2$, $3T/4$.]

**(b)**

[Diagram: Horizontal rod of length 10 m oriented east–west (W to E), falling downward (southward) with velocity $v = 5$ m/s, in the presence of Earth's horizontal magnetic field component $B_H$.]

Given:
- Length of rod: $l = 10\ \text{m}$
- Velocity of rod: $v = 5.0\ \text{m/s}$ (downward, perpendicular to horizontal component of Earth's field)
- Horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field: $B = 0.3 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{Wb/m}^2$
- Angle $\theta = 90°$ (rod falls at right angles to the horizontal magnetic field component)

EMF induced in the rod:
$$e = Blv\sin\theta = 0.3 \times 10^{-4} \times 10 \times 5 \times \sin 90°$$
$$e = 0.3 \times 10^{-4} \times 50 = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{V}$$

$$\boxed{e = 1.5 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{V} = 1.5\ \text{mV}}$$

By Fleming's right-hand rule, the current (and thus the higher potential end) flows from **west to east**.

### Q26.
(a) Define wavefront. Use Huygens' principle to verify the laws of refraction.

**OR**

(a) Draw a ray diagram to show the image formation by a combination of two thin convex lenses in contact. Obtain the expression for the power of this combination in terms of the focal lengths of the lenses.

(b) A ray of light passing from air through an equilateral glass prism underg
