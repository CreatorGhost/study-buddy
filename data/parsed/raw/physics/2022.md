## Section A

### Q1.
Draw energy band diagrams of n-type and p-type semiconductors at temperature $T > 0\ K$, depicting the donor and acceptor energy levels. Mention the significance of these levels.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Energy band diagram showing two semiconductors side by side. For p-type (left): Conduction Band (CB) at top with electrons shown as filled circles, Acceptor Energy Level (EA) as a dashed line close to the Valence Band (VB), and VB at bottom shown with hatching and holes. For n-type (right): CB at top with electrons, Donor Energy Level (ED) as a dashed line close to CB, and VB at bottom with hatching and holes.]

**N-type Semiconductor:**

- **Diagram:** Shows conduction band (CB), valence band (VB), and donor level ($E_D$) close to CB.
- **Significance:** Donor level introduces free electrons as majority carriers, enhancing conductivity by allowing easy excitation of electrons to the CB.

**P-type Semiconductor:**

- **Diagram:** Shows conduction band (CB), valence band (VB), and acceptor level ($E_A$) close to VB.
- **Significance:** Acceptor level creates holes in the VB as majority carriers, enhancing conductivity by facilitating the movement of electrons from VB to $E_A$, leaving behind holes.

### Q2(a).
Draw the graph showing the variation of the number ($N$) of scattered alpha particles with scattering angle ($\theta$) in Geiger–Marsden experiment. Infer two conclusions from the graph.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Graph with scattering angle $\theta$ (0° to 175°) on the x-axis and number of scattered alpha particles $N$ (on a logarithmic scale from $10^{-4}$ to $10^4$) on the y-axis. The curve starts very high at small angles and decreases steeply and continuously as the scattering angle increases toward 180°.]

**Conclusions from the Graph:**

1. **Inverse Relationship:** The number of scattered alpha particles decreases rapidly as the scattering angle increases. This indicates an inverse relationship between the number of scattered particles and the scattering angle.

2. **Confirmation of the Nuclear Model:** The steep decline in the number of particles with increasing angle supports the nuclear model of the atom. It shows that most alpha particles pass through the atom with almost no deflection, implying that the positive charge is concentrated in a small nucleus, while the majority of the atom's volume is empty space.

### Q2(b).
Plot suitable graphs to show the variation of photoelectric current with the collector plate potential for the incident radiation of:

**(i)** the same intensity but different frequencies $\nu_1,\ \nu_2,$ and $\nu_3\ (\nu_1 < \nu_2 < \nu_3)$.

**(ii)** the same frequency but different intensities $I_1,\ I_2,$ and $I_3\ (I_1 < I_2 < I_3)$.

**Answer:**

[Diagram (i): Graph of photoelectric current vs collector plate potential for same intensity, different frequencies. Three curves are shown for $\nu_1$, $\nu_2$, $\nu_3$. All three reach the same saturation current (same intensity), but have different stopping potentials: $\nu_3$ has the largest (most negative) stopping potential, $\nu_2$ intermediate, $\nu_1$ the smallest. The stopping potential increases with frequency.]

[Diagram (ii): Graph of photoelectric current vs collector plate potential for same frequency, different intensities. Three curves shown for $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$. All three have the same stopping potential (same frequency), but different saturation currents: $I_3$ gives the highest saturation current, $I_2$ intermediate, $I_1$ the lowest.]

**Explanation:**

**(i) Same Intensity, Different Frequencies:**
- The photoelectric current starts at zero and then sharply rises to a constant value as the collector plate potential increases. For the lower frequency $\nu_1$, the current begins to increase at a lower potential. For the higher frequency $\nu_3$, the current starts to increase at a higher potential, indicating a higher stopping potential.
- **Threshold Frequency:** The higher the frequency of the incident radiation, the higher the stopping potential required. This demonstrates that higher frequency photons have more energy and require a higher potential to stop the emitted electrons.
- **Same Saturation Current:** Despite different frequencies, the saturation current (maximum current) remains the same because it depends on the intensity, which is constant for both frequencies.

**(ii) Same Frequency, Different Intensities:**
- The photoelectric current increases with the collector plate potential and then saturates. For the lower intensity ($I_1$), the saturation current is lower. For the higher intensity ($I_3$), the saturation current is higher.
- **Proportional to Intensity:** The saturation current is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation. Higher intensity results in a higher number of photons, leading to more emitted electrons and thus a higher current.
- **Same Stopping Potential:** The stopping potential is the same for all intensities, indicating that it is independent of the intensity and depends solely on the frequency of the incident light.

### Q3.
Write the characteristics of a p-n junction which make it suitable for rectification.

**Answer:**

A p-n junction is highly suitable for rectification due to its distinct characteristics:

1. The p-n junction allows current to flow easily in one direction (forward bias) and blocks it in the opposite direction (reverse bias). This property is fundamental for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).

2. **Depletion Region:** When forward biased, the depletion region narrows, reducing resistance and allowing current flow. In reverse bias, the depletion region widens, increasing resistance and blocking current flow.

3. **Forward Voltage Drop:** The p-n junction has a characteristic forward voltage drop, which ensures that current only flows when this threshold is exceeded.

4. **High Reverse Breakdown Voltage:** In reverse bias, the junction can withstand high voltages before breakdown occurs, making it robust for various applications.

## Section B

### Q4.
Define the term — Distance of closest approach. How will it be affected, for an $\alpha$-particle, if kinetic energy of the particle is doubled?

**Answer:**

**Distance of Closest Approach:**
The distance of closest approach is the minimum distance between the nucleus and an incoming alpha particle during a head-on collision. It is the point where the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is fully converted into electrostatic potential energy due to the repulsion between the positively charged alpha particle and the nucleus. At this distance, the alpha particle momentarily comes to rest before being repelled back.

**Effect of Doubling Kinetic Energy:**

1. **Kinetic Energy and Distance Relation:** The distance of closest approach ($d$) is inversely proportional to the kinetic energy (K.E.) of the particle:

$$d \propto \frac{1}{K.E.}$$

2. **Doubling Kinetic Energy:** If the kinetic energy is doubled, the distance of closest approach will be halved. This is because:

$$d_1 = \frac{k \cdot Z_1 \cdot Z_2 \cdot e^2}{K.E.}$$

where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ represent the atomic numbers of the interacting particles.

If K.E. becomes $2\,K.E.$:

$$d_2 = \frac{k \cdot Z_1 \cdot Z_2 \cdot e^2}{2 \cdot K.E.} = \frac{d_1}{2}$$

Thus, doubling the kinetic energy of the alpha particle **reduces the distance of closest approach by half**.

### Q5.
A point source in air is kept 24 cm in front of a concave spherical glass surface $(_a\mu_g = 1.5)$ and radius of curvature 60 cm. Find the nature of the image formed and its distance from the point of source.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Object distance: $u = -24\ \text{cm}$ (negative sign indicates the object is in front of the surface)
- Radius of curvature: $R = 60\ \text{cm}$
- $\mu_1 = 1$ (air), $\mu_2 = 1.5$ (glass)

**Solution:**

Using the refraction formula at a spherical surface:

$$\frac{\mu_2}{v} - \frac{\mu_1}{u} = \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{R}$$

Since the surface is concave and the object is in air, $R = -60\ \text{cm}$:

$$\frac{1.5}{v} - \frac{1}{-24} = \frac{1.5 - 1}{-60}$$

$$\frac{1.5}{v} + \frac{1}{24} = \frac{0.5}{-60}$$

$$\frac{1.5}{v} = -\frac{1}{120} - \frac{1}{24}$$

$$\frac{1.5}{v} = -\frac{1}{120} - \frac{5}{120} = -\frac{6}{120} = -\frac{1}{20}$$

$$v = 1.5 \times (-20) = -30\ \text{cm}$$

> *(Note: The Vedantu solution applies the mirror formula, which is incorrect for a refracting surface. The correct approach using the refraction formula gives $v = -30\ \text{cm}$, indicating a virtual image on the same side as the object, 30 cm from the surface.)*

**Nature of the Image:**
- The image distance $v = -30\ \text{cm}$ (negative), indicating the image is formed on the same side as the object.
- The image is **virtual** and **erect**, located 30 cm from the refracting surface (54 cm from the point source).

### Q6.
Calculate the energy released in MeV in the following reaction:

$$^2_1H + ^3_1H \rightarrow ^4_2He + n$$

**Given:**

$$m(^2_1H) = 2.014102\ u$$
$$m(^3_1H) = 3.016049\ u$$
$$m(^4_2He) = 4.002603\ u$$
$$m(n) = 1.008665\ u$$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

The energy released ($Q$) in the reaction can be found using the mass defect and Einstein's equation $E = \Delta m \cdot c^2$.

**Step 1 — Total mass of reactants:**

$$m_{\text{reactants}} = m(^2_1H) + m(^3_1H) = 2.014102\ u + 3.016049\ u = 5.030151\ u$$

**Step 2 — Total mass of products:**

$$m_{\text{products}} = m(^4_2He) + m(n) = 4.002603\ u + 1.008665\ u = 5.011268\ u$$

**Step 3 — Mass defect:**

$$\Delta m = m_{\text{reactants}} - m_{\text{products}} = 5.030151\ u - 5.011268\ u = 0.018883\ u$$

**Step 4 — Convert mass defect to energy:**

$$Q = \Delta m \cdot 931.5\ \frac{MeV}{u}$$

$$Q = 0.018883\ u \times 931.5\ \frac{MeV}{u} = \mathbf{17.58\ MeV}$$

The energy released in the reaction is $\boxed{17.58\ \text{MeV}}$.

### Q7.
Explain with the help of a suitable diagram, the phenomenon on which an optical fibre works. Mention any two uses of optical fibres.

**Answer:**

**Principle of Operation: Total Internal Reflection**

Optical fibres work on the principle of **total internal reflection**. This phenomenon occurs when a light ray traveling through a denser medium (core) hits the boundary of a less dense medium (cladding) at an angle greater than the critical angle. At this angle, the light ray is completely reflected back into the denser medium rather than refracted into the less dense medium.

[Diagram: A cylindrical optical fibre with the inner core (higher refractive index $n_1$) surrounded by cladding (lower refractive index $n_2$). A light ray enters the core and undergoes repeated total internal reflections at the core-cladding boundary, traveling along the length of the fibre. The point of total internal reflection is labelled.]

- **Core:** The core is the inner part of the fibre where the light travels. It has a higher refractive index $(n_1)$.
- **Cladding:** The cladding surrounds the core and has a lower refractive index $(n_2)$. This difference in refractive indices ensures that light entering the core at a specific angle will undergo total internal reflection.

**Uses of Optical Fibres:**

1. **Telecommunications:** Optical fibres are extensively used in telecommunications to transmit data over long distances with high bandwidth and low signal loss.

2. **Medical Imaging:** Optical fibres are used in medical instruments like endoscopes, which allow doctors to view the inside of a patient's body non-invasively. The flexibility and thinness of optical fibres make them ideal for navigating through small, intricate pathways in the body.

### Q8(a).
A parallel beam of light of wavelength 600 nm is incident normally on a slit of width 0.2 mm. If the resulting diffraction pattern is observed on a screen 1 m away, find the distance of:

**(i)** first minimum, and
**(ii)** second maximum, from the central maximum.

**Answer:**

**Given:**

$$\lambda = 600\ \text{nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{m}$$
$$a = 0.2\ \text{mm} = 0.2 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{m}$$
$$D = 1\ \text{m}$$

**Solution:**

**(i) Distance of the first minimum from the central maximum:**

The condition for minima in single-slit diffraction:

$$a \sin\theta = m\lambda$$

For small angles, $\sin\theta \approx \tan\theta = \dfrac{y}{D}$

For the first minimum ($m = 1$):

$$a \cdot \frac{y_1}{D} = \lambda \implies y_1 = \frac{\lambda D}{a}$$

$$y_1 = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9} \times 1}{0.2 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{600 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-4}} = 3000 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{m} = 3 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{m}$$

$$\boxed{y_1 = 3\ \text{mm}}$$

**(ii) Distance of the second maximum from the central maximum:**

The second minimum ($m = 2$):

$$y_2 = \frac{2\lambda D}{a} = \frac{2 \times 600 \times 10^{-9} \times 1}{0.2 \times 10^{-3}} = 6 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{m} = 6\ \text{mm}$$

The second maximum lies approximately midway between the first and second minima:

$$y_{2_{\max}} \approx \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = \frac{3\ \text{mm} + 6\ \text{mm}}{2} = \frac{9\ \text{mm}}{2}$$

$$\boxed{y_{2_{\max}} \approx 4.5\ \text{mm}}$$

### Q8(b).
A thin equiconvex lens of radius of curvature $R$ made of material of refractive index $\mu_1$ is kept coaxially, in contact with an equiconcave lens of the same radius of curvature and refractive index $\mu_2\ (> \mu_1)$.

Find:
**(i)** the ratio of their powers, and
**(ii)** the power of the combination and its nature.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
- Radius of curvature for both lenses: $R$
- Refractive indices: $\mu_1$ (equiconvex), $\mu_2$ (equiconcave), with $\mu_2 > \mu_1$

**Solution:**

**(i) Ratio of their powers:**

**Power of the equiconvex lens** (using lens maker's formula, with $R_1 = +R$, $R_2 = -R$):

$$P_1 = (\mu_1 - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right) = (\mu_1 - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{-R}\right) = (\mu_1 - 1)\cdot\frac{2}{R}$$

$$P_1 = \frac{2(\mu_1 - 1)}{R}$$

**Power of the equiconcave lens** (with $R_1 = -R$, $R_2 = +R$):

$$P_2 = (\mu_2 - 1)\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right) = (\mu_2 - 1)\left(\frac{1}{-R} - \frac{1}{R}\right) = (\mu_2 - 1)\cdot\left(-\frac{2}{R}\right)$$

$$P_2 = -\frac{2(\mu_2 - 1)}{R}$$

**Ratio of their powers:**

$$\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\dfrac{2(\mu_1 - 1)}{R}}{-\dfrac{2(\mu_2 - 1)}{R}} = -\frac{\mu_1 - 1}{\mu_2 - 1}$$

**(ii) Power of the combination and its nature:**

$$P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 = \frac{2(\mu_1 - 1)}{R} - \frac{2(\mu_2 - 1)}{R}$$

$$P_{\text{total}} = \frac{2(\mu_1 - 1) - 2(\mu_2 - 1)}{R} = \frac{2\mu_1 - 2 - 2\mu_2 + 2}{R}$$

$$\boxed{P_{\text{total}} = \frac{2(\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{R}}$$

**Nature:** Since $\mu_2 > \mu_1$, we have $\mu_1 - \mu_2 < 0$, making $P_{\text{total}}$ **negative**. Hence, the combination acts as a **diverging (concave) lens**.

### Q9.
Photoelectrons are emitted from a metal surface when illuminated with UV light of wavelength 330 nm. The minimum amount of energy required to emit the electrons from the surface is $3.5 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}$. Calculate:

**(i)** the energy of the incident radiation, and
**(ii)** the kinetic energy of the photoelectron.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
$$\lambda = 330\ \text{nm} = 330 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{m}$$
$$\phi = 3.5 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}$$
$$h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s}, \quad c = 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$$

**Solution:**

**(i) Energy of the incident radiation:**

$$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{330 \times 10^{-9}}$$

$$E = \frac{19.89 \times 10^{-26}}{3.3 \times 10^{-7}} = 6.02 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}$$

$$\boxed{E = 6.02 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}}$$

**(ii) Kinetic energy of the photoelectron:**

Using the photoelectric equation:

$$K.E. = E - \phi$$

$$K.E. = 6.02 \times 10^{-19} - 3.5 \times 10^{-19} = 2.52 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}$$

$$\boxed{K.E. = 2.52 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{J}}$$

### Q10.
State the working principle of an LED. Write any two important advantages and two disadvantages of LED.

**Answer:**

**Working Principle of an LED:**

A Light Emitting Diode (LED) works on the principle of **electroluminescence**, where light is emitted as a result of the recombination of electrons and holes in a semiconductor material. When a forward voltage is applied across the LED, electrons from the n-type material and holes from the p-type material are injected into the active region (p-n junction). As electrons and holes recombine, energy is released in the form of photons, producing light.

**Advantages of LEDs:**

1. **Energy Efficiency:** LEDs are highly energy-efficient compared to traditional incandescent and fluorescent lights. They consume significantly less power, leading to reduced energy costs.

2. **Long Lifespan:** LEDs have a much longer lifespan than conventional lighting sources, often lasting tens of thousands of hours. This reduces the frequency and cost of replacements.

**Disadvantages of LEDs:**

1. **Higher Initial Cost:** LEDs typically have a higher initial purchase cost compared to traditional lighting options. Although they save money in the long run, the upfront expense can be a barrier.

2. **Heat Sensitivity:** LEDs are sensitive to high temperatures, which can affect their performance and lifespan. Proper heat management and cooling systems are necessary to maintain their efficiency and longevity.

### Q11(a).

**(i)** Monochromatic light is incident on a surface separating two media. The frequency of the light after refraction remains unaffected but its wavelength changes. Why?

**(ii)** The frequency of an electromagnetic radiation is $1.0 \times 10^{11}\ \text{Hz}$. Identify the radiation and mention its two uses.

**Answer:**

**(i)**
When monochromatic light passes from one medium to another, its **frequency remains constant** because the frequency of light is determined by the source and does not change as it moves between different media.

However, the **wavelength changes** because the speed of light changes in the new medium. The speed of light $v$ in a medium is related to wavelength $\lambda$ and frequency $f$ by:

$$v = f\lambda$$

The refractive index of a medium is:

$$n = \frac{c}{v}$$

Since the speed of light in the new medium is different, the wavelength changes accordingly:

$$\lambda' = \frac{v'}{f}$$

where $\lambda'$ is the wavelength in the new medium and $v'$ is the speed of light in that medium.

Thus, even though the frequency remains the same, the wavelength changes as light moves between different media because its speed changes.

**(ii)**
The electromagnetic radiation with a frequency of $1.0 \times 10^{11}\ \text{Hz}$ falls in the **microwave region** of the electromagnetic spectrum.

**Uses of Microwaves:**

1. **Communication:** Microwaves are used for satellite communications and in cellular phone networks. They transmit signals over long distances and through the atmosphere with minimal interference.

2. **Cooking:** Microwaves are used in microwave ovens for heating and cooking food. They cause water molecules in the food to vibrate, generating heat that cooks the food quickly and efficiently.

**OR**

### Q11(b).

**(i)** Trace the path of a ray of light PQ which is incident at an angle $i$ on one face of a glass prism of angle $A$. It then emerges out from the other face at an angle $e$. Use the ray diagram to prove that the angle through which the ray is deviated is given by:

$$\delta = i + e - A$$

**(ii)** What will be the minimum value of $\delta$ if the ray passes symmetrically through the prism?

**Answer:**

**(i)**

[Diagram: A triangular prism with apex angle $A$. Ray PQ is incident on the first face at angle of incidence $i$. It refracts inside the prism and strikes the second face, where it refracts again and emerges at angle of emergence $e$. The angle of deviation $\delta$ is shown as the angle between the incident ray (extended) and the emergent ray. The refracted ray inside the prism makes angles $r_1$ and $r_2$ with the normals at the first and second faces respectively.]

**Proof:**

At the first refracting surface, the ray is deviated by angle $(i - r_1)$.
At the second refracting surface, the ray is deviated by angle $(e - r_2)$.

Total deviation:
$$\delta = (i - r_1) + (e - r_2) = i + e - (r_1 + r_2)$$

In the triangle formed by the refracted ray inside the prism and the two refracting faces:
$$r_1 + r_2 + (180° - A) = 180°$$
$$\therefore r_1 + r_2 = A$$

Substituting:

$$\boxed{\delta = i + e - A}$$

**(ii) Minimum deviation ($\delta_m$) — Symmetric passage:**

When the ray passes symmetrically through the prism (condition for minimum deviation):
$$i = e \quad \text{and} \quad r_1 = r_2 = r = \frac{A}{2}$$

At minimum deviation $\delta_m$:
$$\delta_m = i + e - A = 2i - A$$
$$\Rightarrow i = \frac{A + \delta_m}{2}$$

Using Snell's law at the first surface:
$$\mu = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{\sin\!\left(\dfrac{A + \delta_m}{2}\right)}{\sin\!\left(\dfrac{A}{2}\right)}$$

This gives the minimum deviation as:

$$\boxed{\delta_m = 2i - A, \quad \text{where } i = \sin^{-1}\!\left[\mu \sin\!\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\right]}$$

## Section C — Case Study

### Q12.
The principle of superposition is used to understand the phenomenon of interference of light waves. The principle states that at a particular point, the resultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector sum of the displacements produced by each wave. Light waves from two coherent sources produce interference pattern. Thomas Young devised a way to obtain two coherent sources using two identical pinholes ($S_1$ and $S_2$) illuminated by a single monochromatic pinhole source $S$. Using these sources in his experiment known as Young's double slit experiment, Young studied the interference pattern. The pattern consists of alternate bright and dark fringes. The distance between two successive bright or dark fringes depends on the distance between $S_1$ and $S_2$, the distance of the screen from the plane of $S_1S_2$ and the wavelength of light used.

---

**I.** Consider the following waves:

**(i)** $y_1 = a\sin\omega t$

**(ii)** $y_2 = a\sin 2\omega t$

**(iii)** $y_3 = a\sin(2\omega t + \phi)$

**(iv)** $y_4 = a\sin\!\left(4\omega t + \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$

Which pair of the waves coming from two sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ will produce interference?

(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (ii) and (iii)
(C) (iii) and (iv)
(D) (iv) and (i)

**Answer:** **(B) (ii) and (iii)**

**Solution:** For interference to occur, two waves must have the **same frequency** and a **constant phase difference** (coherent sources). Waves (ii) and (iii) both have angular frequency $2\omega$ and a constant phase difference $\phi$ between them, so they satisfy the condition for coherence and will produce a stable interference pattern.

---

**II.** Two light waves of the same intensity $I_0$ each, having a path difference of $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$ emanating from two coherent sources, meet at a point. The resultant intensity at the point will be:

(A) Zero
(B) $I_0$
(C) $2I_0$
(D) $4I_0$

**Answer:** **(C) $2I_0$**

**Solution:**

A path difference of $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$ corresponds to a phase difference:

$$\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \times \frac{\lambda}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

The resultant intensity is:

$$I = I_1 + I_2 + 2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\cos\phi = I_0 + I_0 + 2\sqrt{I_0 \cdot I_0}\cos\frac{\pi}{2}$$

$$I = 2I_0 + 2I_0 \times 0 = 2I_0$$

**III.** Vandana performs Young's double slit experiment by using orange, green and red lights successively. If the fringe widths measured in the three cases are $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$ respectively, then which of the following is correct?

(A) $\omega_2 > \omega_1 > \omega_3$
(B) $\omega_1 > \omega_2 > \omega_3$
(C) $\omega_2 > \omega_3 > \omega_1$
(D) $\omega_3 > \omega_1 > \omega_2$

**Answer:** **(D) $\omega_3 > \omega_1 > \omega_2$**

**Solution:**

Fringe width $\beta = \dfrac{\lambda D}{d}$, so fringe width is directly proportional to wavelength. The wavelengths of the colours are:

- Red ($\lambda_3$) $\approx 620$–$750\ \text{nm}$ — largest
- Orange ($\lambda_1$) $\approx 590$–$620\ \text{nm}$ — intermediate
- Green ($\lambda_2$) $\approx 495$–$570\ \text{nm}$ — smallest

Therefore: $\lambda_3 > \lambda_1 > \lambda_2$, which gives $\omega_3 > \omega_1 > \omega_2$.

---

**IV.** In a Young's double slit experiment, the slit separation is 0.8 mm, and the interference pattern is obtained on a screen kept 50 cm from the plane of the slits $S_1$ and $S_2$. If the first bright fringe is formed 0.4 mm from the central maximum, the wavelength of light used is:

(A) 480 nm
(B) 560 nm
(C) 640 nm
(D) 680 nm

**Answer:** **(C) 640 nm**

**Solution:**

Using the fringe position formula $y = \dfrac{n\lambda D}{d}$, for the first bright fringe ($n = 1$):

$$\lambda = \frac{y \cdot d}{D} = \frac{0.4 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.8 \times 10^{-3}}{0.5}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{0.32 \times 10^{-6}}{0.5} = 0.64 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{m} = 640\ \text{nm}$$

---

**V.** Consider the effect on the angular separation of the fringes in a Young's double slit experiment due to the following operations:

**(i)** the screen is moved away from the plane of the slits,
**(ii)** the separation between the two slits is increased till fringes are observed.

Which of the following options is correct?

(A) It remains constant in both cases.
(B) It decreases in both cases.
(C) It remains constant in (i) but decreases in (ii).
(D) It decreases in (i) but remains constant in (ii).

**Answer:** **(C) It remains constant in (i) but decreases in (ii).**

**Solution:**

Angular fringe width $\theta = \dfrac{\lambda}{d}$, which depends only on the wavelength $\lambda$ and the slit separation $d$, and is **independent of the screen distance $D$**.

- **(i)** Moving the screen away changes $D$ but not $d$ or $\lambda$, so the **angular separation remains constant**.
- **(ii)** Increasing slit separation $d$ decreases $\theta = \lambda/d$, so the **angular separation decreases**.
