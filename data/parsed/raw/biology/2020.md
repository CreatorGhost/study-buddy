## Section A — 1 Mark Each

### Q1.
Cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated because

(a) they are bisexual flowers which do not open at all.
(b) they are bisexual and open flowers.
(c) they are unisexual.
(d) their stigma matures before the anthers dehisce.

**Answer:** (a) they are bisexual flowers which do not open at all.

**Solution:** Cleistogamous flowers never open at all. Since both anthers and stigma are enclosed within the same flower and the flower remains closed, self-pollination is guaranteed. This is in contrast to chasmogamous flowers which open and may allow cross-pollination.

**OR**

Asexual reproduction by zoospores is observed in

(a) Penicillium
(b) Hydra
(c) Sponge
(d) Chlamydomonas

**Answer:** (d) Chlamydomonas

**Solution:** Chlamydomonas, a green alga, reproduces asexually by forming zoospores — flagellated, motile spores that can swim in water. Hydra reproduces by budding, sponges by gemmules, and Penicillium by conidia (non-motile spores).

---

### Q2.
The theory of evolution supported by the experiment conducted by Louis Pasteur is

(a) Spontaneous generation theory
(b) Life comes only from pre-existing life
(c) Abiogenesis of life
(d) Big bang theory

**Answer:** (a) Spontaneous generation theory

**Solution:** Louis Pasteur's swan-neck flask experiment disproved the spontaneous generation theory by demonstrating that microorganisms in broth came from the air and not by spontaneous generation. His experiment thus **disproved** spontaneous generation and **supported** the concept that life comes only from pre-existing life (biogenesis). Among the given options, the theory directly tested (and refuted) by his experiment was the Spontaneous Generation Theory.

### Q3.
The diagnostic test that confirms typhoid in humans is

(a) ELISA
(b) Widal
(c) MRI
(d) Amniocentesis

**Answer:** (b) Widal

**Solution:** The Widal test is a serological test used to confirm typhoid fever (caused by *Salmonella typhi*). It detects the presence of specific agglutinating antibodies against the O and H antigens of *Salmonella typhi* in the patient's serum. ELISA is used for detecting HIV; MRI is an imaging technique; Amniocentesis is used for prenatal diagnosis.

---

### Q4.
The bioactive molecule used as an immunosuppressive agent during organ transplant is

(a) Tetracycline
(b) Cyclosporin-A
(c) Statin
(d) Streptomycin

**Answer:** (b) Cyclosporin-A

**Solution:** Cyclosporin-A is a bioactive molecule produced by the fungus *Trichoderma polysporum*. It acts as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting the activation of T-lymphocytes, thereby preventing rejection of transplanted organs. Tetracycline and Streptomycin are antibiotics; Statins are used to lower blood cholesterol.

**OR**

'Blue revolution' refers to

(a) construction of water dams for conservation of water
(b) production of fish in large quantities
(c) sewage treatment
(d) controlling algal bloom

**Answer:** (b) production of fish in large quantities

**Solution:** The Blue Revolution refers to the rapid increase in aquaculture (fish and other aquatic organisms) production, analogous to the Green Revolution in agriculture. It focuses on large-scale production of fish to meet the growing demand for aquatic food resources.

### Q5.
Which one of the following is **not** the product of transgenic experiments?

(a) Pest-resistant crop variety
(b) High nutritional value in grains
(c) Production of insulin by rDNA technique
(d) Drought-resistant crops

**Answer:** (c) Production of insulin by rDNA technique

**Solution:** Production of insulin by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technique involves inserting the human insulin gene into a bacterial host (*E. coli*) to produce insulin — this is a product of recombinant DNA technology but not specifically a transgenic experiment involving a whole organism with a foreign gene stably integrated into its genome. Pest-resistant crops (e.g., Bt crops), high-nutritional-value grains (e.g., Golden Rice), and drought-resistant crops are all products of transgenic plant experiments.

## Section B — 2 Marks Each

### Q6.
Write the ploidy and number of chromosomes in human (a) meiocytes, and (b) gametes.

**Answer:**

**(a) Meiocytes:** Diploid (2n) — **46 chromosomes**

**(b) Gametes:** Haploid (n) — **23 chromosomes**

**Solution:** The number of chromosomes in a cell is described by its ploidy. Chromosomes are thread-like structures that carry DNA, the genetic material. Human meiocytes are the cells that undergo meiosis; they are diploid (2n = 46). After meiosis, the resulting gametes (sperm or egg cells) are haploid, containing half the number of chromosomes (n = 23).

---

### Q7.
What is aneuploidy? Name a chromosomal disorder in humans caused due to (a) gain of an autosome, and (b) loss of a sex chromosome in females.

**Answer:**

**Aneuploidy:** Aneuploidy is the condition in which a cell possesses an abnormal number of chromosomes — either more or fewer than the normal diploid number (e.g., 45 or 47 instead of 46 in humans). It does not involve a difference in complete sets of chromosomes (which would be polyploidy).

**(a) Gain of an autosome:** **Down's Syndrome** (Trisomy 21 — 2n = 47, with an extra copy of chromosome 21)

**(b) Loss of a sex chromosome in females:** **Turner's Syndrome** (45, XO — one X chromosome is absent)

**Solution:** Aneuploidy arises due to non-disjunction during meiosis. In Down's syndrome, there is an extra autosome (chromosome 21), giving 47 chromosomes. In Turner's syndrome, females have only one X chromosome instead of two (45, X), leading to a total of 45 chromosomes.

---

### Q8.
State a functional difference between the following codons:

**(a) AUG and UAA**

**Answer:**

| AUG | UAA |
|-----|-----|
| Start codon (Initiator codon) | Stop codon (Terminator codon) |
| Codes for the amino acid Methionine and initiates translation | Does not code for any amino acid; signals termination of translation |

**Solution:** AUG is the universal start codon that initiates protein synthesis and codes for the amino acid methionine. UAA is one of the three stop (nonsense) codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) that signal the ribosome to terminate translation. No tRNA recognises stop codons.

---

**(b) Specific and Degenerate codons**

**Answer:**

| Specific Codon | Degenerate Codon |
|----------------|-----------------|
| A codon that codes for only one particular amino acid | A situation where more than one codon codes for the same amino acid |
| Only one codon specifies the amino acid | Multiple codons specify the same amino acid |

**Solution:** The genetic code is described as specific because each codon specifies only one amino acid. However, it is also called degenerate because most amino acids are coded by more than one codon (e.g., Leucine is coded by six codons: UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG).

---

### Q9.
**(a) Identify any two marsupials from the list given below:**

(i) Lemur
(ii) Spotted cuscus
(iii) Flying phalanger
(iv) Bobcat
(v) Tasmanian wolf
(vi) Mole

**Answer:** **(iii) Flying phalanger** and **(v) Tasmanian wolf**

**Solution:** Marsupials are mammals belonging to the infraclass Marsupialia, characterised by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young that are then carried and nursed in a pouch. Flying phalanger (*Petaurus* sp.) and Tasmanian wolf (*Thylacinus cynocephalus*) are classic Australian marsupials. Lemur is a primate (found in Madagascar), Bobcat is a placental feline, and a Mole is a placental insectivore.

---

**(b) "Australian marsupials exhibit adaptive radiation." Justify the statement.**

**Answer & Solution:** Adaptive radiation is the process by which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available. Australian marsupials are all descended from a common marsupial ancestor and, because Australia became geographically isolated, these marsupials diversified to fill various ecological niches — giving rise to forms resembling wolves (Tasmanian wolf), moles (marsupial mole), flying squirrels (flying phalanger), and many others. This diversification from a common ancestor into multiple ecologically distinct forms on the Australian continent is a classic example of adaptive radiation.

### Q10.
Name the type of immunity the mother provides the newborn baby. How does it happen?

**Answer:** The mother provides **Passive Immunity** to the newborn baby.

**Solution:** Passive immunity is the type of immunity in which readymade antibodies are transferred from one individual to another without the recipient's immune system actively producing them. In the case of a newborn, passive immunity is conferred through:
- **Placenta** — IgG antibodies are transferred from mother to foetus across the placenta during pregnancy.
- **Colostrum (mother's first milk)** — the yellowish fluid secreted in the first few days after birth is rich in **IgA antibodies**, which protect the infant's gut from pathogens.

This immunity is temporary, lasting only a few weeks to months, until the baby's own immune system becomes functional.

---

### Q11.
Name the two primary lymphoid organs. State the importance of T-lymphocytes.

**Answer:**

**Two Primary Lymphoid Organs:**
1. **Bone Marrow**
2. **Thymus**

**Solution:** The bone marrow is the site where all blood cells, including lymphocytes, are produced (haematopoiesis). The thymus is the site where T-lymphocytes mature and become immunocompetent. These organs are called "primary" because immune cells are produced and/or mature there.

**Importance of T-lymphocytes:**

(a) **Cell-mediated immunity** — T-cells directly destroy infected or abnormal cells (cytotoxic T-cells).
(b) **Helper function** — T-helper cells (CD4⁺) assist B-cells in the production of antibodies.
(c) **Graft rejection** — T-cells are responsible for recognising and rejecting foreign transplanted tissue.
(d) **Memory** — Memory T-cells provide long-lasting immunity upon re-exposure to the same antigen.

### Q12.
How are malignant tumors different from benign tumors? Why are some patients treated with α-interferons?

**Answer:**

**Difference between Malignant and Benign Tumors:**

| Benign Tumor | Malignant Tumor |
|--------------|----------------|
| Remains localised; does not invade surrounding tissues | Invades and destroys surrounding tissues |
| Does not metastasise (spread to distant sites) | Metastasises via blood or lymph to distant organs |
| Grows slowly; enclosed in a fibrous capsule | Grows rapidly; no capsule |
| Less harmful; rarely life-threatening | Highly dangerous; can be life-threatening (cancer) |

**Why are some patients treated with α-interferons?**

Some cancer patients are treated with **α-interferons (alpha-interferons)** because they are biological response modifiers that:
- Activate the patient's own immune system to fight tumour cells.
- Inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.
- Enhance the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells that destroy tumour cells.

**Solution:** Interferons are proteins naturally produced by virus-infected cells. α-interferons have anti-tumour and antiviral properties and are used therapeutically as immunostimulants in certain cancers (e.g., hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia).

**OR**

Name the hormone with which a cow is administered using MOET technology. State the function of this hormone.

**Answer:** In MOET (Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer Technology), the cow is administered **Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**.

**Solution:** MOET is a programme for herd improvement in which a cow of high genetic merit is given FSH-like hormones to induce superovulation (production of 6–8 eggs per cycle instead of one). The fertilised embryos are then recovered non-surgically and transferred to surrogate mothers.

**Functions of FSH:**

(a) FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles in females.
(b) It stimulates superovulation — multiple eggs are produced in one cycle.
(c) In males, FSH acts on Sertoli cells and is required for the regulation of spermatogenesis.
(d) In children, FSH levels rise at puberty, stimulating production of oestrogen (females) and testosterone (males).

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q13.
Draw a longitudinal section of the pistil from a flowering plant where pollination has occurred. Label the following:

(a) Stigma showing germinating pollen grains
(b) Style
(c) Pollen tube reaching the micropyle of the ovule
(d) Embryo sac
(e) Components of the egg apparatus

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Longitudinal section of pistil after pollination — a flask-shaped structure with a broad stigma at the top bearing germinating pollen grains (a); a long narrow style below it (b); the pollen tube growing down through the style and entering the ovule through the micropyle (c); within the ovule, the embryo sac (d) showing the egg apparatus at the micropylar end comprising the egg cell (female germ cell), two synergids with filiform apparatus, and three antipodal cells at the chalazal end; a large central cell with two polar nuclei in the middle of the embryo sac (e = egg apparatus consisting of egg cell + 2 synergids).]

**Labels:**
- **(a)** Stigma with germinating pollen grains
- **(b)** Style
- **(c)** Pollen tube reaching the micropyle of the ovule
- **(d)** Embryo sac
- **(e)** Egg apparatus = Egg cell (female germ cell) + 2 Synergids (with filiform apparatus)

---

### Q14.
Study the given diagram:

[Diagram: Structure A (a compact ball of cells — Morula) transforms into Structure B (a hollow ball — Blastocyst) with two distinct regions labelled C (inner cell mass/embryoblast) and D (outer layer of cells — Trophoblast).]

A is an embryonic stage that gets transformed into B, which in turn gets implanted in the endometrium in human females.

**(a) Identify A, B, and its parts C and D.**

**(b) State the fate of C and D in the course of embryonic development in humans.**

**Answer:**

**(a) Identification:**

- **A** = Morula (a solid ball of cells formed by repeated cleavage of the zygote)
- **B** = Blastocyst (the hollow ball stage that implants in the endometrium)
- **C** = Inner Cell Mass (ICM) / Embryoblast (the cluster of cells inside the blastocyst)
- **D** = Trophoblast (the outer single layer of cells surrounding the blastocyst)

**(b) Fate of C and D:**

- **C — Inner Cell Mass (Embryoblast):** Differentiates to form the **embryo proper** and gives rise to all the tissues and organs of the developing foetus. These are **pluripotent stem cells**.
- **D — Trophoblast:** Attaches to the endometrium during implantation and eventually forms the **placenta** (along with maternal decidua). The placenta facilitates exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the mother and the developing embryo.

---

**OR**

**(a) Identify the figure given below and also identify the parts B, C, D, and E.**

[Diagram: A mature dicot embryo showing a seed with: A = Seed coat region at top; B = Suspensor (a filamentous chain of cells connecting embryo to seed wall); C = Radicle (embryonic root at the lower end); D = Plumule (embryonic shoot/bud at the upper end of the embryo axis); E = Cotyledon (a large fleshy seed leaf on either side of the embryo axis).]

**(b) State the function of E.**

**Answer:**

**Figure identified as:** Mature Dicot Embryo

**(a) Parts:**
- **B** = Suspensor
- **C** = Radicle (embryonic root)
- **D** = Plumule (embryonic shoot)
- **E** = Cotyledon (seed leaf)

**(b) Function of E (Cotyledon):**
- Cotyledons store food reserves (starch, proteins, fats) that nourish the embryo during germination before the seedling becomes photosynthetically self-sufficient.
- They may also absorb and transfer nutrients from the endosperm to the developing embryo.
- In some plants, cotyledons emerge above ground and become photosynthetic (epigeal germination), serving as the first photosynthetic organs of the seedling.

### Q15.
A normal couple has their first child, who is haemophilic. Work out a cross to show how it is possible. State the possibility of the normal and the haemophilic children, along with their sexes, that can be born to them.

**Answer:**

**Explanation:** Haemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. Since the parents appear normal but have a haemophilic son, the mother must be a **carrier female** ($X^H X^h$) and the father is a **normal male** ($X^H Y$).

**Cross:**

$$\text{Carrier Female} \; (X^H X^h) \;\times\; \text{Normal Male} \; (X^H Y)$$

**Gametes produced:**
- Female gametes: $X^H$ and $X^h$
- Male gametes: $X^H$ and $Y$

**Punnett Square:**

|  | $X^H$ (from father) | $Y$ (from father) |
|--|--|--|
| $X^H$ (from mother) | $X^H X^H$ — Normal Daughter | $X^H Y$ — Normal Son |
| $X^h$ (from mother) | $X^H X^h$ — Carrier Daughter | $X^h Y$ — Haemophilic Son |

**Offspring possibilities (each 25%):**

| Genotype | Phenotype | Sex |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| $X^H X^H$ (25%) | Normal | Female (daughter) |
| $X^H Y$ (25%) | Normal | Male (son) |
| $X^H X^h$ (25%) | Normal carrier | Female (daughter) |
| $X^h Y$ (25%) | Haemophilic | Male (son) |

**Summary:**
- **Normal daughters** — 25% (but 50% of daughters are carriers)
- **Normal sons** — 25%
- **Carrier daughters** — 25%
- **Haemophilic sons** — 25%
- No haemophilic daughters are produced in this cross.

### Q16.
Starting from the pioneer species, trace the sequence that follows in an ecological succession on a bare rock, until the climax community is reached in an ecosystem. Name this type of succession.

**Answer:**

**Type of Succession:** **Primary Succession** — it occurs on bare, lifeless substrata (like bare rock) where no community has existed before.

**Sequence of succession on a bare rock (Xerarch succession / Lithosere):**

$$\text{Bare Rock} \rightarrow \text{Lichens (Pioneer species)} \rightarrow \text{Mosses (Bryophytes)} \rightarrow \text{Herbaceous plants} \rightarrow \text{Shrubs} \rightarrow \text{Trees (Climax Forest Community)}$$

**Detailed steps:**

1. **Bare Rock:** No soil; the substrate is unable to support life.
2. **Lichens (Pioneer Species):** Lichens are the first colonisers. They secrete acids that weather and dissolve the rock surface, contributing to soil formation. They also trap dust and organic matter.
3. **Mosses (Bryophytes):** As thin soil accumulates, mosses colonise and hold a small amount of soil. They further enrich the soil with organic matter upon death.
4. **Herbaceous plants (Grasses and Ferns):** With more soil available, small herbs and grasses establish. Root action further breaks rock; organic matter continues to accumulate.
5. **Shrubs:** As soil deepens and nutrients increase, shrubs replace herbs, providing shade and shelter.
6. **Trees / Forest (Climax Community):** Finally, large trees colonise and form a stable, self-sustaining climax forest community that persists indefinitely under the prevailing climatic conditions.

**Solution:** Primary succession is a slow process (can take thousands of years on bare rock) because it begins with no soil. Each successive community modifies the environment, making it suitable for the next community, until the final stable climax community is reached.

### Q17.
The release of municipal wastewater and industrial waste into our natural water bodies is causing a disastrous effect on aquatic life. Explain the biological treatment that should be given to it before releasing it into the natural water bodies.

**Answer:**

Municipal and industrial wastewater must be treated using a **Secondary (Biological) Treatment** process before discharge into natural water bodies. This treatment reduces the **Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)** of the effluent using microorganisms.

**Steps of Biological (Secondary) Treatment:**

**Step 1 — Primary Treatment (Physical):**
- Wastewater passes through screens to remove large debris.
- It then enters a grit chamber and settling tanks where suspended solids settle as **primary sludge**.
- The liquid (primary effluent) proceeds to biological treatment.

**Step 2 — Secondary (Biological) Treatment:**

1. **Aeration Tanks:** The primary effluent is pumped into large aeration tanks where it is continuously and mechanically agitated and air is pumped in. This promotes the growth of **aerobic microorganisms** (bacteria and fungi) that form **flocs** — masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments.

2. **Microbial Action:** These aerobic microbes consume and decompose a large proportion of the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the BOD of the effluent.

3. **Settling Tanks (Secondary Clarifier):** The effluent from the aeration tank passes into settling tanks where flocs are allowed to sediment, forming **activated sludge**.

4. **Activated Sludge Recycling:**
   - A small portion of activated sludge is returned to the aeration tank as an **inoculum** (seed) to maintain the microbial population.
   - The bulk of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called **anaerobic sludge digesters**.

5. **Anaerobic Sludge Digesters:** Anaerobic bacteria digest the organic matter in the sludge. During this process, **biogas** (a mixture of methane, H₂S, and CO₂) is produced, which can be used as a source of energy.

6. **Final Effluent:** The treated effluent (with greatly reduced BOD) can now be safely discharged into natural water bodies or rivers.

**Solution:** This biological treatment is essential because untreated sewage contains high levels of organic matter, pathogens, and nutrients that can cause eutrophication, oxygen depletion (hypoxia), and death of aquatic organisms.

### Q18.
Mention any two advantages of the micropropagation technique. Write how its process is carried out in the laboratory. Name any two important food plants grown commercially by this method.

**Answer:**

**Two Advantages of Micropropagation:**

1. **Rapid mass multiplication:** A very large number of genetically identical plants (clones) can be produced from a single plant in a short period of time.
2. **Production of disease-free plants:** Meristem tissue culture can produce **virus-free and pathogen-free plants** even from diseased parent plants.
3. *(Additional advantage):* Plants that do not produce viable seeds (e.g., banana, seedless grapes) can be propagated.

**Process of Micropropagation in the Laboratory:**

1. **Explant selection:** A small piece of plant tissue (explant) — such as shoot tip, axillary bud, leaf piece, or root tip — is taken from the selected plant.
2. **Surface sterilisation:** The explant is surface-sterilised using sodium hypochlorite or ethanol to remove contaminants.
3. **Inoculation:** The sterilised explant is placed on a sterile **nutrient medium** (containing minerals, sucrose, vitamins, and plant growth regulators — auxins and cytokinins) in a culture vessel under aseptic conditions.
4. **Callus formation:** The explant dedifferentiates and proliferates to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a **callus**.
5. **Regeneration (Organogenesis/Somatic embryogenesis):** By adjusting the ratio of plant hormones, the callus is induced to differentiate and form **shoots and roots** (plantlets).
6. **Hardening (Acclimatisation):** The regenerated plantlets are transferred to the greenhouse and then gradually acclimatised to natural outdoor conditions before field planting.

**Two Important Food Plants Grown Commercially by Micropropagation:**

1. **Banana** (*Musa* sp.)
2. **Potato** (*Solanum tuberosum*)

*(Others include: Tomato, Strawberry, Sugarcane, Orchids)*

### Q19.
When *Bacillus thuringiensis* enters a certain insect's body, the insect gets killed, but itself remains unaffected. Explain how it is possible.

**Answer:**

**Mechanism by which *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) kills insects but remains unaffected itself:**

1. ***Bacillus thuringiensis*** is a gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium. During sporulation (spore formation), it synthesises crystalline proteins called **Cry proteins** (δ-endotoxins) encoded by **cry genes**.

2. These Cry proteins are produced as **inactive protoxins** (pro-proteins) within the bacterial cell. In the bacterium itself, the protein exists in an **inactive form** — it does not harm the bacterium.

3. When an insect larva **ingests Bt spores or crystals** along with food:
   - The alkaline pH of the insect's midgut (gut pH > 9.5) causes the protoxin crystals to **solubilise**.
   - The alkaline conditions and specific **proteases** (enzymes) present in the insect gut activate the inactive protoxin by proteolytic cleavage, converting it into the **active toxic form**.

4. The **active Cry toxin** binds to specific receptor proteins on the epithelial cells of the insect's midgut, creating **pores (ion channels)** in the cell membrane. This leads to:
   - Cell swelling and lysis (rupture).
   - Disruption of the gut epithelium.
   - The insect stops feeding, is paralysed, and eventually dies.

5. **Why *Bt* itself is unaffected:** The Cry proteins exist as **insoluble crystalline inclusions** inside the bacterium at neutral/acidic pH and are thus harmless to the bacterium. The toxin is only activated under the specific alkaline conditions and proteases unique to the susceptible insect's gut — conditions that do not exist inside the bacterial cell itself.

### Q20.

**(a) Write how parasites have evolved with adaptation to co-exist with their hosts in an ecosystem.**

**Answer & Solution:**

Parasites have evolved numerous adaptations to successfully exploit their hosts while maintaining a long-term relationship (co-existence):

1. **Loss of unnecessary organs:** Many parasites have lost organs not needed for a parasitic lifestyle (e.g., tapeworms lack a digestive system; parasitic plants like *Cuscuta* lack chlorophyll).
2. **Specialised attachment organs:** Parasites have evolved hooks, suckers, or haustoria to firmly attach to host tissues (e.g., Plasmodium invading RBCs; tapeworm scolex with hooks).
3. **Immune evasion:** Parasites can disguise themselves by coating with host proteins, suppressing host immune responses, or changing their surface antigens (antigen variation), allowing them to avoid elimination.
4. **High reproductive capacity:** Producing large numbers of offspring/eggs ensures transmission to new hosts even when most are destroyed.
5. **Complex life cycles:** Many parasites use intermediate hosts and vectors to enhance transmission efficiency.
6. **Reduced virulence over time:** Parasites that kill their host too quickly lose their habitat, so natural selection often favours reduced virulence, enabling longer co-existence.

---

**(b) Parasites are host-specific and tend to co-evolve. How would the parasite respond if the host evolves a certain mechanism to resist or reject the parasite?**

**Answer & Solution:**

This is the concept of **co-evolution** (specifically, the "arms race" between host and parasite):

- When a **host evolves a resistance mechanism** (e.g., immune recognition, structural barriers, or biochemical resistance) to resist or reject the parasite, this creates strong **selective pressure** on the parasite population.
- Parasites that can **overcome the host's resistance** will survive and reproduce more successfully than those that cannot.
- Over successive generations, the parasite **co-evolves** by developing **counter-adaptations** — new mechanisms to neutralise or evade the host's resistance (e.g., antigen variation, new binding sites, immune suppression).
- This reciprocal evolutionary response — host evolving resistance → parasite evolving counter-resistance — continues in a cyclical manner, driving both host and parasite to constantly evolve.

**OR**

**(a) Name an ideal pyramid existing in an ecosystem. Construct it up to its three trophic levels along with their names.**

**Answer:**

**Ideal Pyramid:** The **Pyramid of Energy** is the only pyramid that is always upright and is considered the ideal ecological pyramid. It is never inverted.

**Pyramid of Energy (up to 3 trophic levels):**

$$\text{Trophic Level 3 (Carnivores / Secondary Consumers): } 100 \text{ J}$$
$$\text{Trophic Level 2 (Herbivores / Primary Consumers): } 1000 \text{ J}$$
$$\text{Trophic Level 1 (Producers / Plants): } 10{,}000 \text{ J}$$

[Diagram: Upright pyramid divided into three horizontal blocks. Bottom block (widest) = Producers (Plants) — 10,000 J. Middle block = Herbivores (Primary Consumers) — 1,000 J. Top block (narrowest) = Carnivores (Secondary Consumers) — 100 J. Energy decreases by ~90% at each successive trophic level (10% law).]

**Solution:** According to Lindeman's **10% Law**, only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next; 90% is lost as heat during metabolic processes. Hence the pyramid of energy is always broad at the base and narrow at the top.

---

**(b) The sun provides 1,000,000 J of sunlight (solar energy) to an ecosystem. Write the amount of energy that is available to the first and third trophic levels, respectively.**

**Answer:**

- Only **1%** of incident solar energy is fixed by plants through photosynthesis.

$$\text{Energy fixed at Trophic Level 1 (Producers)} = 1\% \times 10{,}00{,}000 \text{ J} = \mathbf{10{,}000 \text{ J}}$$

- Applying the **10% law** successively:

$$\text{Trophic Level 2 (Herbivores)} = 10\% \times 10{,}000 = 1{,}000 \text{ J}$$

$$\text{Trophic Level 3 (Carnivores)} = 10\% \times 1{,}000 = \mathbf{100 \text{ J}}$$

**Summary:**

| Trophic Level | Energy Available |
|---|---|
| First (Producers) | **10,000 J** |
| Second (Herbivores) | 1,000 J |
| **Third (Carnivores)** | **100 J** |

### Q21.
Global carbon is fixed in the biosphere through photosynthesis.

**(a) Explain any two ways by which carbon is returned to the atmosphere through natural processes.**

**Answer:**

1. **Respiration by living organisms (plants and animals):**
   - All living organisms — plants, animals, fungi, and microbes — carry out cellular respiration.
   - During aerobic respiration, organic compounds (glucose) are oxidised to release energy, producing CO₂ as a by-product:
     $$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{Energy (ATP)}$$
   - This CO₂ is released into the atmosphere, returning carbon from living organisms back to the carbon pool.

2. **Decomposition of dead organic matter by decomposers (bacteria and fungi):**
   - When plants and animals die, decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down complex organic molecules in dead matter through the process of **decomposition**.
   - This biochemical breakdown of dead organic matter releases CO₂ back into the atmosphere (and nutrients into the soil).
   - The continuous addition of decaying plant residues to soil surfaces drives this carbon cycling process.

*(Additional natural process: Volcanic eruptions release CO₂ stored in the earth's crust back into the atmosphere.)*

---

**(b) List any two human activities that have influenced the carbon cycle in nature.**

**Answer:**

1. **Burning of fossil fuels (Fossil fuel combustion):**
   - Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are fossilised forms of ancient organic matter. Burning these fuels for energy (in industries, vehicles, power plants) releases enormous quantities of CO₂ that had been locked away for millions of years:
     $$\text{Fossil Fuel} + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O + \text{Energy}$$
   - This significantly increases atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, disrupting the carbon cycle and contributing to global warming.

2. **Deforestation and burning of forests (forest fuelwood burning):**
   - Forests act as major carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric CO₂ through photosynthesis.
   - Cutting and burning forests for agriculture, timber, or fuel releases the carbon stored in trees back into the atmosphere as CO₂.
   - Deforestation also reduces the capacity of the biosphere to fix CO₂, further disrupting the carbon cycle.

### Q22.
Study the schematic representation given below and answer the following questions:

[Diagram: A box labelled "Population Density (N)" at the centre. Arrow labelled "A" enters from the left with a "+" sign (indicating increase). Arrow labelled "B" exits to the right with a "−" sign (indicating decrease). Arrow labelled "C" enters from above with a "+" sign (indicating increase). Arrow labelled "D" exits below with a "−" sign (indicating decrease).]

**(a) Identify A in it.**

**Answer:** **A = Natality (Birth Rate)**

**Solution:** 'A' has a positive (+) effect on population density, entering from outside (immigration) or from within the population. Given its positive contribution combined with the diagram context, A represents **Natality** — the birth rate in a population. Natality increases population density. It is calculated as total live births per 1,000 individuals per unit time. High natality relative to mortality results in population growth.

---

**(b) Identify D in it.**

**Answer:** **D = Mortality (Death Rate)**

**Solution:** 'D' exits downward with a negative (−) effect on population density — this represents **Mortality** (death rate). Mortality decreases population density. It is the frequency with which individuals die in a given population over a given period. When mortality exceeds natality, population declines.

*(Note: In the standard NCERT representation: A = Natality, B = Emigration, C = Immigration, D = Mortality)*

| Symbol | Represents | Effect on Population |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| A | Natality (birth rate) | + (increases N) |
| B | Emigration (individuals leaving) | − (decreases N) |
| C | Immigration (individuals entering) | + (increases N) |
| D | Mortality (death rate) | − (decreases N) |

---

**(c) When the population density at time t is N as shown above, write the population density at time t + 1 in the form of an equation using appropriate symbols.**

**Answer:**

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + [(B + I) - (D + E)]$$

**Where:**
- $N_{t+1}$ = Population density at time $t + 1$
- $N_t$ = Population density at time $t$
- $B$ = Number of births during the time period
- $I$ = Number of immigrants entering during the time period
- $D$ = Number of deaths during the time period
- $E$ = Number of emigrants leaving during the time period

**Solution:** Population density at any given time is a function of natality, mortality, immigration, and emigration. Births and immigration add to the population; deaths and emigration reduce it.

### Q23.
**(a) Identify steps A and B in a cycle of Polymerase Chain Reaction given below.**

[Diagram: PCR cycle diagram showing: Double-stranded DNA with primers annealed at each end — this stage is labelled **A** (Annealing). After addition of DNA polymerase and deoxynucleotides, the complementary strands are extended to form two complete double-stranded DNA molecules — this stage is labelled **B** (Extension/Elongation).]

**Answer:**

- **A = Annealing:**
  Short, single-stranded DNA sequences called **primers** bind (anneal) to their complementary sequences on the separated single-stranded template DNA. This occurs at a lower temperature (typically 50–65°C depending on primer sequence). Primers define the specific region of DNA to be amplified.

- **B = Extension (Elongation):**
  DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) uses the free 3'-OH of each primer and extends the new complementary DNA strand in the 5'→3' direction, using the deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) present in the reaction mixture. The result is two complete double-stranded DNA molecules from the original template. This occurs at approximately **72°C** (optimum temperature for Taq polymerase).

*(The three steps of PCR are: (1) Denaturation at ~94°C → (2) Annealing at ~50–65°C → (3) Extension at ~72°C)*

---

**(b) State the specific characteristic feature of the enzyme in carrying step B.**

**Answer:** The enzyme involved in Step B is **Taq DNA Polymerase** (isolated from the thermophilic bacterium *Thermus aquaticus*).

**Specific characteristic feature:** Taq DNA polymerase is **thermostable (heat-stable)** — it retains its enzymatic activity even at the high temperatures used during PCR. It has a half-life of approximately **40 minutes at 95°C** and an optimum activity temperature of **72°C**. This thermostability is essential because the denaturation step of each PCR cycle requires heating to ~94–95°C, which would inactivate most ordinary DNA polymerases. Taq polymerase survives these repeated high-temperature cycles and continues to extend the DNA strand during the extension step.

**Solution:** The theoretical amplification of template DNA after $n$ PCR cycles is $2^n$ (assuming no limiting reagents and full enzyme activity throughout).

### Q24.
Study the diagrammatic representation of S.L. Miller's experiment given below and answer the questions that follow:

[Diagram: Miller–Urey apparatus — A large sealed flask connected to a smaller flask half-filled with water (representing the primitive ocean). The large flask contains a gaseous mixture of CH₄, NH₃, H₂, and H₂O vapour (primitive atmosphere). Electrodes in the large flask produce electrical sparks simulating lightning. A condenser cools the gases, and a U-shaped trap collects the cooled water containing synthesised organic compounds. A heat source under the small flask generates water vapour. A sampling probe is present.]

**(a) How did S.L. Miller create the conditions which existed before the origin of any life on Earth?**

**Answer & Solution:**

S.L. Miller (in 1953, along with Harold Urey) simulated the **conditions of primitive Earth** in a closed laboratory apparatus:

1. **Primitive atmosphere:** A mixture of gases believed to have constituted the early Earth's atmosphere — **methane (CH₄), ammonia (NH₃), hydrogen (H₂), and water vapour (H₂O)** — was taken in a sterile, sealed flask. (The early atmosphere was reducing — lacking free oxygen.)

2. **Primitive ocean:** A smaller flask half-filled with water was connected to the system and heated to generate water vapour, simulating the primitive warm oceans.

3. **Energy source (Lightning simulation):** Continuous electrical sparks were fired between electrodes in the flask to simulate the energy provided by **lightning** in the primitive Earth's atmosphere.

4. **Condensation:** The simulated atmosphere was then cooled through a condenser, causing water (containing any synthesised compounds) to condense and collect in a U-shaped trap at the bottom, simulating precipitation into the primitive ocean.

---

**(b) Name the organic compound formed and collected at the end of his experiment.**

**Answer:** **Amino acids** were the organic compounds formed and collected.

**Solution:** After running the experiment continuously for about a week:
- The water in the trap turned **pink after one day** and **deep red and turbid after a week**.
- Analysis using **paper chromatography** revealed the presence of several **amino acids**, including:
  - **α-alanine** (positively identified)
  - **β-alanine** (positively identified)
  - **Aspartic acid** (less certain)
  - **α-aminobutyric acid (AABA)** (less certain)

These amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — had been synthesised abiotically from simple inorganic molecules under simulated primitive Earth conditions.

---

**(c) Mention the kind of evolution his experiment supports.**

**Answer:** Miller's experiment supports **Chemical Evolution** (Abiogenesis or prebiotic evolution).

**Solution:** Chemical evolution refers to the origin of life through the gradual, abiotic (non-biological) formation of increasingly complex organic molecules from simple inorganic molecules (like CH₄, NH₃, H₂, and H₂O) present on the primitive Earth. Miller's experiment demonstrated that the building blocks of life (amino acids) can be synthesised spontaneously under conditions resembling primitive Earth — supporting the **Oparin-Haldane hypothesis** of chemical evolution. Chemical evolution is considered the first step in the origin of life, occurring over less than one billion years during the early history of Earth.

### Q25.
**(a) Draw the sectional view of a seminiferous tubule of humans. Label its six parts.**

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Cross-sectional (transverse section) view of a seminiferous tubule — a circular tubule with the following cells arranged from the outer periphery to the central lumen:
1. **Spermatogonium** — large, round cells at the basement membrane (outermost layer); these are the stem cells that divide to produce spermatocytes.
2. **Sertoli cells** — tall columnar supporting cells extending from the basement membrane to the lumen; they nourish developing sperm cells.
3. **Primary spermatocyte** — large cells in the middle layers, formed by mitotic division of spermatogonia; undergo meiosis I.
4. **Secondary spermatocyte** — smaller cells produced after meiosis I; undergo meiosis II.
5. **Spermatid** — small, round cells produced after meiosis II; they differentiate (spermiogenesis) into spermatozoa.
6. **Spermatozoa (Sperm)** — mature sperm cells with tails projecting into the lumen of the tubule.]

**Six labelled parts:**
1. Spermatogonium
2. Primary spermatocyte
3. Secondary spermatocyte
4. Spermatid
5. Spermatozoa
6. Sertoli cell

**(b) Name the pituitary hormones involved in the process of spermatogenesis. State their functions.**

**Answer:**

Two pituitary hormones (gonadotropins) are involved in spermatogenesis:

**1. FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone):**
- Secreted by the **anterior pituitary gland**.
- In males, FSH acts on the **Sertoli cells** of the seminiferous tubules.
- It stimulates Sertoli cells to secrete **Androgen Binding Protein (ABP)**, which concentrates testosterone in the seminiferous tubules — essential for spermatogenesis.
- FSH is essential for the **initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis**.

**2. LH (Luteinising Hormone) / ICSH (Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone):**
- Also secreted by the **anterior pituitary gland**.
- In males, LH acts on the **Leydig cells (Interstitial cells)** present in the connective tissue between seminiferous tubules.
- It stimulates Leydig cells to synthesise and secrete **testosterone (androgen)**.
- **Testosterone** is essential for the completion of spermatogenesis, development of secondary sexual characteristics, and maintenance of male reproductive functions.

**Summary:**

| Hormone | Site of Action | Function in Males |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| FSH | Sertoli cells | Stimulates ABP production; initiates and maintains spermatogenesis |
| LH (ICSH) | Leydig cells | Stimulates testosterone secretion; testosterone drives spermatogenesis |

Both FSH and LH are regulated by **GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)** secreted by the hypothalamus, as part of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

**OR**

**(a) IUDs are said to be effective contraceptives. Name any two commonly used IUDs and write the mode of their actions.**

**Answer:**

**IUD = Intrauterine Device** — a contraceptive device inserted into the uterus by a medical professional.

**Two commonly used IUDs:**

1. **CuT (Copper-T) / Copper-releasing IUDs** (e.g., CuT-380A, Multiload-375):
   - **Mode of action:**
     - Copper ions ($Cu^{2+}$) released by the device are **spermicidal** — they suppress sperm motility and fertilising capacity of sperm.
     - Copper ions also make the uterine environment **hostile for sperm survival**.
     - They may also prevent **fertilisation** and **implantation**.

2. **Progestasert / Hormone-releasing IUDs** (e.g., Progestasert, LNG-IUS/Mirena):
   - **Mode of action:**
     - These devices slowly release **progesterone** (or levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestogen) into the uterine lumen and endometrium.
     - Progesterone makes the **uterus unsuitable for implantation** (alters endometrial lining).
     - It also thickens **cervical mucus**, preventing sperm entry into the uterus.
     - It may suppress ovulation in some cases.

---

**(b) When is sterilisation advised to married couples? How is it carried out in a human male and a female, respectively?**

**Answer:**

**When sterilisation is advised:**
Sterilisation (surgical contraception) is advised to married couples as a **terminal and permanent method** of contraception when they:
- Have completed their desired family size.
- Wish to avoid any further pregnancies definitively.
- Have medical conditions where pregnancy would be dangerous.
It is considered a **last resort** and should be undertaken only after careful counselling, as it is largely irreversible.

**In Human Male — Vasectomy:**
- A small portion of the **vas deferens** (the duct carrying sperm from the testes to the urethra) on both sides is **surgically cut and tied (ligated)** or blocked through a small incision in the scrotum.
- This prevents sperm from being released during ejaculation (semen is still produced but contains no sperm).
- It is a simple, safe, out-patient procedure performed under local anaesthesia.

**In Human Female — Tubectomy (Tubal Ligation):**
- A small portion of each **fallopian tube** (oviduct) is **surgically cut, tied, and ligated** or blocked (by cauterisation, clips, or rings), usually performed laparoscopically.
- This prevents the egg (ovum) released from the ovary from reaching the uterus, thereby preventing fertilisation.
- The procedure is performed under general or spinal anaesthesia; small incisions are made near the navel and a laparoscope is used to visualise and seal the tubes.

### Q26.
Explain the expression of *lac* operon genes in *E. coli* growing in a lactose-containing culture medium.

**Answer:**

**The *lac* operon** is a classic example of **negative inducible gene regulation** (an operon that is switched on by an inducer molecule — lactose).

**Components of the *lac* operon:**
- **Structural genes:** *lacZ* (β-galactosidase), *lacY* (permease), *lacA* (transacetylase)
- **Promoter (P):** where RNA polymerase binds
- **Operator (O):** where the repressor binds
- **Regulator gene (*lacI*):** encodes the lac repressor protein (constitutively expressed)

**Expression in the presence of lactose (inducer present):**

1. When lactose is present in the culture medium, it enters the cell (via a small amount of permease already present) and is converted to **allolactose** (an isomer of lactose) by β-galactosidase.

2. **Allolactose acts as the inducer** — it binds to the **lac repressor protein** (a tetramer encoded by the *lacI* gene).

3. Binding of allolactose to the repressor causes a **conformational change** in the repressor, reducing its affinity for the operator sequence.

4. The **repressor dissociates from the operator**, freeing the operator region.

5. **RNA polymerase** can now bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes (*lacZ*, *lacY*, *lacA*) as a **polycistronic mRNA (lac mRNA)**.

6. The lac mRNA is translated to produce:
   - **β-galactosidase** — cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose
   - **Permease** — facilitates entry of lactose into the cell
   - **Transacetylase** — transfers acetyl group (role in detoxification)

7. These enzymes metabolise lactose. Once all lactose is consumed, allolactose disappears, the repressor re-binds to the operator, and transcription is switched off (**feedback regulation**).

**Summary Diagram of *lac* operon regulation:**

$$\text{Lactose present} \rightarrow \text{Allolactose formed} \rightarrow \text{Binds repressor} \rightarrow \text{Repressor inactivated} \rightarrow \text{Operator free} \rightarrow \text{RNA polymerase transcribes } lacZ, lacY, lacA$$

$$\rightarrow \beta\text{-galactosidase + Permease + Transacetylase produced} \rightarrow \text{Lactose metabolised}$$

**Solution:** This is an example of an **inducible operon** — normally switched off (repressed) but turned on by the presence of the substrate (lactose/allolactose inducer).

**OR**

Name the types of cells and the process by which hnRNA is formed. Describe the processing mechanism it undergoes before it becomes functional.

**Answer:**

**Cells and process by which hnRNA is formed:**

- **hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA)** is formed in **eukaryotic cells** (specifically in the **nucleus** of all eukaryotic cells).
- It is produced by the process of **transcription**, catalysed by the enzyme **RNA Polymerase II** (in eukaryotes).
- hnRNA is the primary transcript — a direct copy of the gene (template DNA strand), containing both coding sequences (**exons**) and non-coding sequences (**introns**).

**Processing of hnRNA (pre-mRNA processing) before it becomes functional mRNA:**

hnRNA undergoes extensive **post-transcriptional processing** in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm as mature, functional mRNA:

**1. Capping (5' Capping):**
- A modified guanosine nucleotide (**7-methylguanosine triphosphate / m⁷G cap**) is added to the **5' end** of the hnRNA.
- This occurs even before transcription is complete.
- **Function:** Protects mRNA from degradation by 5'-exonucleases; aids in ribosome recognition and attachment during translation; facilitates nuclear export.

**2. Tailing (3' Polyadenylation):**
- A stretch of **200–300 adenine nucleotides (Poly-A tail)** is added to the **3' end** of the hnRNA by the enzyme **poly-A polymerase**, after the transcript is cleaved at a specific site.
- **Function:** Protects mRNA from degradation by 3'-exonucleases; aids in nuclear export; enhances translation efficiency; determines mRNA stability.

**3. Splicing (Removal of introns):**
- The **introns** (intervening non-coding sequences) are precisely **excised (removed)** from the hnRNA.
- The **exons** (expressed coding sequences) are joined together in a defined order.
- This is carried out by a large ribonucleoprotein complex called the **spliceosome** (composed of snRNPs — small nuclear ribonucleoproteins).
- **Alternative splicing** can occur, allowing one pre-mRNA to give rise to multiple different mRNA variants.

**After all three processing steps:**
- The mature, processed mRNA (with 5' cap, exon sequences only, and 3' poly-A tail) is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through nuclear pores.
- In the cytoplasm, the mature mRNA is translated by ribosomes into a polypeptide chain.

$$\text{DNA} \xrightarrow{\text{Transcription (RNA Pol II)}} \text{hnRNA (pre-mRNA)} \xrightarrow{\text{5' Capping + 3' Poly-A tailing + Splicing}} \text{Mature mRNA} \xrightarrow{\text{Translation}} \text{Protein}$$

### Q27.
There is a great concern all over the world to conserve biodiversity for maintaining the ecological balance in nature. Explain giving three reasons. Write different ways that have helped in increasing the tiger population in our country.

**Answer:**

**Why biodiversity must be conserved — Three reasons:**

**1. Narrowly Utilitarian (Direct economic value):**
- Biodiversity provides humans with numerous direct economic benefits:
  - **Food** — most of our crop plants and domesticated animals are derived from wild species.
  - **Medicines** — over 25% of pharmaceutical drugs are derived from plants (e.g., quinine from *Cinchona*, morphine from *Papaver*).
  - **Industrial products** — timber, fibres, rubber, resins, dyes, and many raw materials come from biodiversity.
  - **Fuel** — wood and other biological sources of energy.

**2. Broadly Utilitarian (Indirect/ecosystem services):**
- Biodiversity contributes to critical **ecosystem services** that support all life on Earth:
  - **Production of oxygen** through photosynthesis and maintenance of the atmospheric composition.
  - **Pollination** of crops and wild plants (by bees, butterflies, birds).
  - **Nutrient cycling** and soil formation by decomposers.
  - **Climate regulation** (forests as carbon sinks).
  - **Water purification** and **flood control** by wetlands.
  - **Aesthetic value** — biodiversity contributes to ecotourism, recreation, and cultural enrichment.
- The Amazon rainforest is estimated to produce 20% of the total oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.

**3. Ethical (Intrinsic / moral value):**
- Every species — regardless of its utility to humans — has an **intrinsic value** and a right to exist.
- We share the Earth with millions of other species and have a **moral responsibility** (stewardship) to protect them and pass on our **biological legacy** to future generations in good condition.
- The loss of any species represents an irreversible loss of unique evolutionary history — we do not have the right to cause extinctions.

**Ways that have helped in increasing tiger population in India:**

India launched **Project Tiger** in 1973 to protect the Bengal tiger (*Panthera tigris tigris*). The following approaches have contributed to increasing tiger numbers:

**1. In situ conservation (Protection in natural habitat):**
- Establishment of **Tiger Reserves** — designated protected areas under Project Tiger where tigers and their entire ecosystem are protected (e.g., Jim Corbett, Ranthambore, Sundarbans, Bandipur, Kanha).
- **Biosphere Reserves, National Parks, and Wildlife Sanctuaries** provide legal protection to tiger habitats.
- Strict **anti-poaching measures** and deployment of forest guards.
- Protecting the natural prey base (deer, wild boar) to support tigers.
- **Community involvement** — local communities around reserves are engaged in conservation.

**2. Ex situ conservation (Protection outside natural habitat):**
- **Zoological parks** maintain tigers in captivity, with breeding programmes.
- **Captive breeding** programmes help increase numbers and can be used for reintroduction.
- **Cryopreservation** of genetic material (gametes) for future use.

**3. Legal and policy measures:**
- The **Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972** provides strict legal protection to tigers — hunting and trade are banned.
- **CITES** (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) bans international trade in tiger parts.
- The **National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)** monitors and manages tiger reserves.

**4. Scientific monitoring:**
- Regular **tiger census** using camera traps and pugmark counting to track population changes and inform conservation strategies.

**Result:** India's tiger population has shown a significant increase — from approximately 1,411 tigers in 2006 to over 3,000 tigers in recent censuses, demonstrating the success of these conservation measures.

What is integrated organic farming? How did Ramesh Chandra Dagar, a farmer from Sonepat, Haryana effectively use this procedure and succeed with zero waste?

**Answer:**

**Integrated Organic Farming:**
Integrated Organic Farming is a **cyclical, zero-waste farming system** that integrates multiple agricultural practices in a chain of interdependent processes, such that the waste output of one process serves as an input (nutrient) for another. It uses organic methods — avoiding chemical fertilisers and pesticides — and relies on the natural interrelationships between different components (crops, animals, microorganisms, water) to sustain productivity and soil health.

**Key features:**
- Uses **organic wastes** (crop residues, animal dung, farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and biological materials as inputs.
- Incorporates **biofertilisers** (beneficial microorganisms) to release nutrients naturally.
- Maintains soil health and minimises external inputs.
- Produces no waste — every output is recycled as an input elsewhere in the system.

---

**How Ramesh Chandra Dagar implemented it successfully (Zero Waste Model):**

Ramesh Chandra Dagar, a farmer from Sonepat, Haryana, integrated several enterprises on his farm into a cyclic, waste-free system:

1. **Beekeeping:** Bees pollinate crops (improving yields) and produce honey (additional income). Beeswax is also a by-product.

2. **Dairy management:** Cattle are maintained on the farm. Their **dung** is used directly as organic fertiliser (replacing expensive chemical fertilisers) or converted into **biogas**.

3. **Biogas generation:** Cattle dung is fed into a **biogas plant**, which produces:
   - **Biogas (methane)** — used as cooking fuel and energy for the farm, reducing dependence on external energy.
   - **Slurry** — the spent material from the biogas plant is a rich organic fertiliser returned to the fields.

4. **Composting:** Crop waste, animal waste, and other organic matter are composted and used to enrich soil fertility naturally.

5. **Water harvesting:** Rainwater is collected and stored for irrigation, reducing dependence on groundwater.

6. **Agriculture:** Crops are grown without chemical pesticides or fertilisers — using the compost, biogas slurry, and natural manure produced on-farm.

**Result — Zero Waste:**
- The output of each process (dung, crop waste, water) feeds into another process as input.
- No external chemical inputs are needed; no waste is generated.
- The farm is **self-sustaining, economically viable, and environmentally friendly**.
- This model demonstrates the practical success of integrated organic farming as a sustainable agricultural alternative.
