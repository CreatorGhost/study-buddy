**Solution:**
- **Satellite DNA** are repetitive DNA sequences that show a **high degree of polymorphism** and form the basis of DNA fingerprinting.
- Since DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair follicle, skin, bone, saliva, etc.) from an individual shows the **same degree of polymorphism**, they become a very useful **identification tool** in forensic applications.
- As the polymorphisms are **inheritable from parents to children**, DNA fingerprinting is the basis of **paternity testing** in case of disputes.

---

### Q13.
What does the following equation represent? Explain.

$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
This equation represents the **Hardy–Weinberg Principle**.

According to this principle:
- **Allele frequencies** in a population are **stable and constant** from generation to generation.
- The **gene pool** (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains constant.
- This is called **genetic equilibrium**.
- The **sum total of all allele frequencies** is always equal to **1**.

In the equation:
- $p$ = frequency of dominant allele
- $q$ = frequency of recessive allele
- $p^2$ = frequency of homozygous dominant genotype
- $2pq$ = frequency of heterozygous genotype
- $q^2$ = frequency of homozygous recessive genotype

---

### Q14.
Two independent monohybrid crosses were carried out involving a tall pea plant with a dwarf pea plant. In the first cross, the offspring population had equal number of tall and dwarf plants, whereas in the second cross it was different. Work out the crosses, and explain giving reasons for the difference in the offspring populations.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**

**First Cross:**

$$Tt \times tt$$

[Diagram: Punnett square for Tt × tt]

|   | T  | t  |
|---|----|----|
| t | Tt | tt |
| t | Tt | tt |

- **50% Tall (Tt)** : **50% Dwarf (tt)**

**Reason:** One parent is **heterozygous dominant (Tt)** and the other is **homozygous recessive (tt)**; therefore half the offspring are tall and half are dwarf.

---

**Second Cross:**

$$Tt \times Tt$$

[Diagram: Punnett square for Tt × Tt]

|   | T  | t  |
|---|----|----|
| T | TT | Tt |
| t | Tt | tt |

- **TT : Tt : tt = 1 : 2 : 1**
- **Tall : Dwarf = 3 : 1**

**Reason:** Here **both the parents are heterozygous dominant (Tt)**; hence the offspring ratio is **3 tall : 1 dwarf**, which is different from the first cross.

---

### Q15.
State what is apomixis? Comment on its significance. How can it be commercially used?

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
- **Apomixis** is a form of **asexual reproduction** that **mimics sexual reproduction** — seeds are formed without fertilization.
- **Significance:**
  - It is a **cost-effective method**.
  - It prevents the **loss of specific characters** (hybrid vigour is maintained across generations).
- **Commercial use:** It can be used in the **hybrid seed industry** to maintain hybrid seeds without repeated crossing, saving time and cost.

- These sequences were introduced separately into **plasmids of *Escherichia coli*** (*E. coli*) to produce the respective insulin chains.
- **Chain A and Chain B** were produced separately, then **extracted** and **combined** by creating **disulfide bonds** to form the functional human insulin molecule (**Humulin**).

---

### Q19.
Explain co-evolution with reference to parasites and their hosts. Mention any four special adaptive features evolved in parasites for their parasitic mode of life.

**Answer:**

**Solution:**
**Co-evolution** in host-parasite relationships:
- Parasites have evolved to be **host-specific** in such a way that both the host and the parasite tend to **co-evolve**.
- If the host evolves special mechanisms for **rejecting or resisting** the parasite, the parasite has to evolve mechanisms to **counteract and neutralise** them in order to survive with the same host species.

**Four special adaptive features evolved in parasites:**
1. **Loss of unnecessary sense organs**
2. **Loss of digestive system** and development of **high reproductive capacity**
3. **Presence of adhesive organs or suckers** to attach to the host
4. **Complex life cycle involving two or more hosts** (e.g., *Plasmodium* uses both mosquito and human as hosts)

### Q24.
(a) List the different attributes that a population has and not an individual organism.
(b) What is population density? Explain any three different ways the population density can be measured, with the help of an example each.

**OR**

It is often said that the pyramid of energy is always upright. On the other hand, the pyramid of biomass can be both upright and inverted. Explain with the help of examples and sketches.

**Answer:**

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a) Attributes of a population (not possessed by an individual):**

1. **Natality:** Refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density.
2. **Mortality:** The number of deaths in the population during a given period.
3. **Immigration:** The number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the period under consideration.
4. **Emigration:** The number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the period under consideration.
5. **Sex ratio, age distribution, population density** — characteristics that apply only to a group, not an individual.

**(b) Population Density:**
Population density (designated as **N**) is the number of individuals of a species per unit area or volume at a given time.

**Three ways to measure population density:**

1. **Direct Counting (Total Number):**
   - Most appropriate measure for most organisms.
   - Example: Counting the number of trees per hectare in a forest.

2. **Per cent cover or Biomass:**
   - Used when total numbers are meaningless (e.g., comparing one banyan tree with 200 *Parthenium* plants — the banyan has far greater biomass/cover despite low numbers).
   - Example: Measuring the **per cent ground cover** of grass in a meadow.

3. **Indirect Methods (Relative Density):**
   - Used when direct counting is impossible or very time-consuming.
   - Example: **Number of fish caught per trap** as a measure of the total fish population density in a lake; or **pug marks and faecal pellets** used for tiger census in national parks and tiger reserves.

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative Question):**

**Pyramid of Energy — Always Upright:**
- Energy at a **lower trophic level is always more** than at a higher trophic level.
- When energy flows from one trophic level to the next, **some energy is always lost as heat** at each step (as per the **10% law**).
- Therefore, the pyramid of energy can **never be inverted**.

[Diagram: Upright Pyramid of Energy]

| Trophic Level | Energy |
|---|---|
| TC (Tertiary Consumers) | 10 J |
| SC (Secondary Consumers) | 100 J |
| PC (Primary Consumers) | 1,000 J |
| PP (Primary Producers) | 10,000 J |
| Sunlight Input | 1,000,000 J |

*Primary producers convert only ~1% of sunlight energy into NPP.*

---

**Pyramid of Biomass — Can be Upright or Inverted:**

**Upright Pyramid of Biomass** (e.g., terrestrial ecosystem):

| Trophic Level | Dry weight (kg m⁻²) |
|---|---|
| TC | 1.5 |
| SC | 11 |
| PC | 37 |
| PP | 809 |

*Biomass shows a sharp decrease at higher trophic levels.*

---

**Inverted Pyramid of Biomass** (e.g., aquatic/marine ecosystem):

| Trophic Level | Biomass |
|---|---|
| PC (Zooplankton) | 21 |
| PP (Phytoplankton) | 4 |

*The biomass of fishes (consumers) far exceeds that of phytoplankton (producers) at any given time because phytoplankton reproduce and turn over very rapidly.*

### Q25.
(a) Plan an experiment and prepare a flow chart of the steps that you would follow to ensure that the seeds are formed only from the desired sets of pollen grains. Name the type of experiment that you carried out.
(b) Write the importance of such experiments.

**OR**

Describe the roles of pituitary and ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle in a human female.

**Answer:**

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a) Experiment: Artificial Hybridisation**

The technique used is **emasculation and bagging** to ensure pollination only from the desired male parent.

**Flow Chart:**

$$\text{Select the female parent plant bearing bisexual flowers}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\text{Emasculation — remove anthers from flower bud before anther dehisces (using forceps)}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\text{Bagging — cover emasculated flower with a butter paper bag to prevent contamination}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\text{When stigma attains receptivity, collect mature pollen from desired male parent}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\text{Dust the collected pollen on the receptive stigma of the bagged flower}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\text{Re-bag the flower and allow the fruits to develop}$$

**Type of experiment:** **Artificial Hybridisation**

**(b) Importance:**
By this experiment, breeders can **combine desirable characters** of two different varieties/species to produce **commercially superior hybrid varieties** with improved yield, disease resistance, and quality traits.

---

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative Question):**

**Roles of Pituitary and Ovarian Hormones during the Menstrual Cycle:**

1. **Follicular Phase:**
   - The secretion of **gonadotropins — LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)** — from the **pituitary gland** increases gradually.
   - FSH stimulates **follicular development** and secretion of **estrogens** by the growing follicles.

2. **Ovulatory Phase (around Day 14):**
   - Both **LH and FSH** attain a **peak level** in the middle of the cycle.
   - A **rapid surge in LH** (called **LH surge**) induces the **rupture of the Graafian follicle**, leading to **ovulation** (release of the ovum).

3. **Luteal Phase:**
   - After ovulation, the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform into the **corpus luteum**.
   - The corpus luteum secretes **large amounts of progesterone**.
   - **Progesterone** is essential for the **maintenance of the endometrium** (uterine lining).
   - This endometrium is necessary for the **implantation of the fertilized ovum** and other events of pregnancy.
   - If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone levels fall, and **menstruation** occurs.

### Q26.
(a) Why are colour-blindness and thalassemia categorised as Mendelian disorders? Write the symptoms of these diseases seen in people suffering from them.
(b) About 8% of human male population suffers from colour-blindness whereas only about 0.4% of human female population suffers from this disease. Write an explanation to show how it is possible.

**OR**

Explain the process of transcription in prokaryotes. How is the process different in eukaryotes?

**Answer:**

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a)**
Colour-blindness and Thalassemia are considered **Mendelian disorders** because they occur due to **mutation in a single gene**.

**Symptoms of Colour-blindness:**
- Failure to **differentiate between red and green colour** (red-green colour blindness is most common).

**Symptoms of Thalassemia:**
- Causes formation of **abnormal haemoglobin molecules**, resulting in **anaemia** (reduced ability of blood to carry oxygen).

**(b) Explanation for sex-based difference in colour-blindness:**
- The gene for **red-green colour blindness** is located on the **X chromosome** (X-linked recessive).
- **Males** have only **one X chromosome (XY)**, so if they inherit even one copy of the defective allele, they are colour blind.
- **Females** have **two X chromosomes (XX)**, so they need **two copies** of the defective recessive allele to be colour blind — making it far less common (0.4%).
- The **son of a carrier woman** has a **50% chance** of being colour blind.
- The **mother is not herself colour blind** because the gene is **recessive** and her second X chromosome carries the normal allele (she is a carrier: $X^N X^c$).

---

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative Question):**

**Transcription in Prokaryotes:**

- In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: **mRNA** (messenger RNA), **tRNA** (transfer RNA), and **rRNA** (ribosomal RNA) — all needed to synthesize a protein.
- There is a **single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase** that catalyses transcription of all types of RNA in bacteria.
- **Steps of Transcription:**
  1. **Initiation:** RNA polymerase binds to the **promoter** region and initiates transcription with the help of an **initiation factor (sigma factor, σ)**.
  2. **Elongation:** RNA polymerase uses **nucleoside triphosphates** as substrates and polymerises in a template-dependent fashion following the **rule of complementarity**. It facilitates opening of the DNA helix and continues elongation.
  3. **Termination:** Once the polymerase reaches the **terminator region**, the nascent RNA falls off, as does the RNA polymerase, with the help of a **termination factor (rho factor, ρ)**.
- Since mRNA **does not require processing** to become active, and transcription and translation occur in the **same compartment** (no nucleus), **transcription and translation can be coupled** in bacteria.

---

**Differences Between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Transcription:**

| Feature | Prokaryotic Transcription | Eukaryotic Transcription |
|---|---|---|
| Coupling | Coupled transcription–translation is the **rule** | Coupled transcription–translation is **not possible** |
| Location | Occurs in the **cytoplasm** | Occurs in the **nucleus** |
| RNA Polymerase | **Single RNA polymerase** synthesises all three types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) | **Three RNA polymerases** (I, II, III) synthesise rRNA, mRNA, and tRNA respectively |
| RNA Processing | RNAs are released and **processed in the cytoplasm** | RNAs are released and **processed in the nucleus** (capping, tailing, splicing) |
| Transcriptional Unit | Has one or more genes — **Polycistronic** | Has only one gene — **Monocistronic** |
| rRNA Formation | 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs are formed from a **single primary transcript** | 28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs are formed from **two primary transcripts** |
