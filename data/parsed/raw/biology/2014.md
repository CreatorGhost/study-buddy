## Section A — 1 Mark Each

### Q1.
Name the part of the flower which the tassels of the corn-cob represent.

**Answer:** Style

**Solution:** The tassels of a corn-cob represent the **style** of the flower. In maize (*Zea mays*), the long, thread-like tassels hanging from the top of the corn-cob are the styles and stigmas of the female flowers, which catch pollen during wind pollination.

---

### Q2.
Mention any two contrasting traits with respect to seeds in pea plant that were studied by Mendel.

**Answer:**
- **Seed shape:** Round and Wrinkled
- **Seed colour:** Yellow and Green

**Solution:** Mendel studied seven pairs of contrasting traits in pea plants (*Pisum sativum*). Among those related to seeds, he observed seed shape (round vs. wrinkled) and seed colour (yellow vs. green), which served as clear contrasting characters for his hybridization experiments.

### Q3.
Why is secondary immune response more intense than the primary immune response in humans?

**Answer:** Because our body has immunological memory of the first encounter with the antigen.

**Solution:** When the immune system encounters an antigen for the first time, it mounts a **primary immune response** and simultaneously produces memory B-cells and memory T-cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen, these memory cells recognize it quickly and mount a **secondary (anamnestic) immune response** that is faster, more intense, and produces a higher titre of antibodies compared to the primary response.

### Q4.
Why is it not possible for an alien DNA to become part of a chromosome anywhere along its length and replicate normally?

**Answer:** Because the origin of replication is not present in the alien/recombinant DNA at arbitrary locations.

**Solution:** DNA replication in a cell is initiated only at specific sequences called **origins of replication (ori)**. An alien DNA inserted randomly into a chromosome, without possessing or being near a functional *ori*, cannot initiate replication independently. Therefore, it cannot replicate normally unless it is linked to a vector that carries its own origin of replication.

### Q5.
State the role of C peptide in human insulin.

**Answer:** The C peptide keeps insulin in its inactive (dormant) form called **proinsulin**.

**Solution:** Human insulin is initially synthesized as a longer, inactive precursor called **proinsulin**, which consists of three chains — A, B, and C. The **C peptide** (connecting peptide) links the A and B chains and maintains the molecule in its inactive conformation. When proinsulin is processed in the Golgi apparatus, the C peptide is cleaved off, yielding the mature, active insulin molecule consisting of A and B chains linked by disulfide bonds.

### Q6.
Name the enzymes that are used for the isolation of DNA from bacterial and fungal cells for recombinant DNA technology.

**Answer:**
- Enzyme used to isolate DNA from **bacteria:** **Lysozyme**
- Enzyme used to isolate DNA from **fungi:** **Chitinase**

**Solution:** To isolate DNA from cells, the cell wall must first be degraded. Bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan, which is broken down by **lysozyme**. Fungal cell walls are composed of chitin, which is broken down by **chitinase**. In plant cells, **cellulase** is used to degrade the cellulose cell wall.

---

### Q7.
State Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle.

**Answer:** It states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely, and the competitively inferior one will eventually be eliminated.

**Solution:** Proposed by **G.F. Gause**, the Competitive Exclusion Principle (also called Gause's Principle) holds that when two species occupy the same ecological niche and compete for identical resources, one species will always outcompete the other. The competitively inferior species will either go locally extinct or be forced to shift its niche — a phenomenon known as **niche differentiation**. This principle underscores the importance of resource partitioning in maintaining biodiversity.

---

### Q8.
Name the type of association that the genus *Glomus* exhibits with higher plants.

**Answer:** Mycorrhiza (specifically **Endomycorrhiza / Arbuscular Mycorrhiza**)

> **Note:** The document states "Ectomycorrhiza," however *Glomus* is correctly known to form **endomycorrhizal (arbuscular mycorrhizal)** associations with higher plants.

**Solution:** The genus *Glomus* belongs to the group of fungi that form **mycorrhizal** associations with the roots of higher plants. The fungal hyphae help the plant absorb water and minerals (especially phosphorus) from the soil, while the plant provides organic carbon (sugars) to the fungus. This is a classic example of **mutualism**.

## Section B — 2 Marks Each

### Q9.
Why are the human testes located outside the abdominal cavity? Name the pouch in which they are present.

**Answer:** Human testes are located outside the abdominal cavity in a pouch called the **scrotum**.

**Solution:** The testes are located in the **scrotum** because spermatogenesis requires a temperature approximately **2–2.5°C lower** than the normal internal body temperature (37°C). The scrotum acts as a thermoregulatory organ, maintaining this lower temperature essential for the production and viability of spermatozoa. If the testes remain in the abdominal cavity (a condition called **cryptorchidism**), it leads to infertility.

### Q10.
In Snapdragon, a cross between true-breeding red flowered (RR) plants and true-breeding white flowered (rr) plants showed a progeny of plants with all pink flowers.

**(a)** The appearance of pink flowers is not known as blending. Why?

**(b)** What is this phenomenon known as?

**Answer:**

**(a)** The appearance of pink flowers is **not blending** because the different alleles (R and r) do **not** mix or fuse with each other. They remain distinct and **segregate** from each other during gamete formation (according to Mendel's Law of Segregation). This is proven because when the F₁ pink plants (Rr) are self-fertilized, the F₂ generation gives red (RR), pink (Rr), and white (rr) flowers in a **1:2:1 ratio**, recovering the original parental phenotypes.

**(b)** This phenomenon is known as **Incomplete Dominance**.

**Solution:** In incomplete dominance, neither allele is completely dominant over the other. The heterozygous phenotype (Rr → pink) is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes (RR → red; rr → white). The cross can be represented as:

$$P: RR \times rr$$
$$F_1: Rr \text{ (all pink)}$$
$$F_1 \times F_1: Rr \times Rr$$
$$F_2: 1\,RR : 2\,Rr : 1\,rr = 1\text{ Red} : 2\text{ Pink} : 1\text{ White}$$

---

### Q11.
With the help of one example, explain the phenomena of co-dominance and multiple allelism in human population.

**Answer:**

**Example: ABO Blood Group System in Humans**

**Co-dominance:** When both alleles of a gene express themselves completely and simultaneously in a heterozygous individual, it is called co-dominance.
- Blood group A → contains **A antigen** on RBC surface (genotype $I^A I^A$ or $I^A i$)
- Blood group B → contains **B antigen** on RBC surface (genotype $I^B I^B$ or $I^B i$)
- Blood group AB → contains **both A and B antigens** (genotype $I^A I^B$)

In individuals with genotype $I^A I^B$, both $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles are expressed equally and simultaneously → this is **co-dominance**.

**Multiple Allelism:** When more than two alleles exist for a single gene locus in a population, it is called multiple allelism.

In the ABO blood group system, there are **three alleles** — $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$ — for a single gene locus. Any individual carries only two of these alleles, but three alleles exist in the human population, making this a classic example of **multiple allelism**.

### Q12.
Write the scientific name of the fruit-fly. Why did Morgan prefer to work with fruit-flies for his experiments? State any three reasons.

**Answer:**

**Scientific name:** *Drosophila melanogaster*

**Reasons Morgan preferred fruit-flies:**
1. **Short life span** — completes its life cycle in about 2 weeks, allowing observation of many generations quickly.
2. **Easy to culture** — can be easily maintained and cultured in the laboratory on simple media at low cost.
3. **Contrasting features are easily observed** — possesses many easily distinguishable morphological traits (e.g., eye colour, wing shape, body colour).
4. **Produces a large number of offspring** — a single mating produces hundreds of progeny, providing statistically significant data.

**OR**

Linkage and crossing-over of genes are alternatives of each other. Justify with the help of an example.

**Answer:**

**Linkage** and **crossing-over** are indeed opposite/alternative phenomena:

- **Linkage** is the tendency of two or more genes located on the **same chromosome** to be inherited together as a unit from parent to offspring. Linked genes do **not** assort independently.
- **Crossing-over** is the exchange of chromosomal segments between **homologous chromosomes** during meiosis I (at the chiasmata stage of prophase I), which **separates** previously linked genes and produces **recombinant gametes**.

**Example (Morgan's experiment with *Drosophila*):**

Morgan studied two genes in *Drosophila* — body colour (yellow 'y' vs. grey 'Y') and wing type (white 'w' vs. red 'W'), both located on the X chromosome (sex-linked).

- When genes showed **complete linkage**, they were inherited together → no new combinations appeared.
- When **crossing-over** occurred between these genes, recombinant phenotypes (yellow body + red wings; grey body + white wings) appeared.

Thus, **linkage** keeps genes together while **crossing-over** separates them — they are alternatives to each other. The **frequency of crossing-over** (recombination frequency) between two genes is inversely proportional to the strength of linkage.

### Q13.
List the symptoms of Ascariasis. How does a healthy person acquire this infection?

**Answer:**

**Symptoms of Ascariasis** (caused by *Ascaris lumbricoides*):
1. Vitamin A deficiency
2. Fever
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Eosinophilia
5. Appendicitis
6. Internal bleeding
7. Muscular pain
8. Anaemia

**Mode of infection:** A healthy person acquires this infection through consumption of **water, food, fruits, or vegetables** that are contaminated with **embryonated eggs** of *Ascaris*. The eggs hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae that eventually develop into adult worms.

---

### Q14.
Explain the significant role of the genus *Nucleopolyhedrovirus* in an ecologically sensitive area.

**Answer:**

*Nucleopolyhedrovirus* (NPV) is a type of **baculovirus** that specifically attacks insects and other arthropods, thereby naturally controlling their populations.

**Significance in ecologically sensitive areas:**
- These viruses are excellent candidates for **species-specific, narrow-spectrum insecticidal applications**.
- They have been shown to have **no negative impact** on higher animals, plants, or humans.
- This specificity is highly desirable when **beneficial insects** (e.g., pollinators) need to be conserved as part of an **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)** program.
- NPVs can be used to control pest populations in ecologically sensitive areas **without disturbing the rest of the ecosystem**, unlike broad-spectrum chemical pesticides.

### Q15.
How does a restriction nuclease function? Explain.

**Answer:**

A **restriction endonuclease** (also called a restriction enzyme) is a **hydrolytic enzyme** naturally found in bacteria, where it functions as part of the bacterial defense system against foreign (e.g., bacteriophage) DNA.

**Mechanism of action:**
1. The enzyme **recognizes specific short palindromic nucleotide sequences** (4–8 base pairs) on double-stranded DNA, called **restriction sites**.
2. It binds to the DNA at the restriction site and **cleaves the internal phosphodiester bonds** between specific nucleotides on both strands of the DNA molecule.
3. The cut may be **staggered** (producing sticky/cohesive ends) or **blunt** (producing blunt ends).

**Example — EcoRI:**

[Diagram: EcoRI cuts dsDNA at the sequence 5'—G↓AATTC—3' / 3'—CTTAA↑G—5', producing sticky ends with 5'-AATT overhangs]

$$5'\text{---G} \downarrow \text{AATTC---}3'$$
$$3'\text{---CTTAA} \uparrow \text{G---}5'$$

The enzyme cuts between G and A on both strands, generating **sticky (cohesive) ends** (5'-AATT overhangs). These sticky ends can anneal with complementary sticky ends from other DNA fragments cut by the same enzyme, which is exploited in recombinant DNA technology.

### Q16.
How have transgenic animals proved to be beneficial in:

**(a)** Production of biological products

**(b)** Chemical safety testing

**Answer:**

**(a) Production of biological products:**
Biological products used in medicine are generally very expensive to produce by conventional means. Transgenic animals can be engineered to carry the **gene for a desired human protein**, which is then expressed and harvested.

- **Example:** Transgenic cows/sheep carrying the human gene for **α-1-antitrypsin** produce this protein in their milk. α-1-antitrypsin is used to treat patients with **emphysema**.
- Similarly, transgenic goats have been produced to secrete **human clotting factors** (e.g., Factor IX) in their milk for treating haemophilia.

**(b) Chemical safety testing:**
- Transgenic animals are created by insertion of genes that make them **more sensitive to toxic substances** than normal animals.
- These animals are then **exposed to the chemical** being tested, and the effects are studied.
- This allows researchers to detect toxicity at **lower concentrations and in shorter time periods**, making safety testing faster and more reliable.
- **Example:** Transgenic mice carrying human gene sequences are used to test the carcinogenicity of chemicals.

### Q17.
Describe the mutual relationship between fig tree and wasp and comment on the phenomenon that operates in their relationship.

**Answer:**

The relationship between the **fig tree** (*Ficus*) and the **fig wasp** is a classic example of **obligate mutualism**.

**The relationship:**
- The female wasp enters the developing **fig inflorescence (syconium)** to lay her eggs inside the developing ovules.
- While searching for a suitable oviposition site, the wasp **transfers pollen** from one fig flower to another, thereby **pollinating the fig inflorescence**.
- The developing seeds within the fig serve as **food for the wasp larvae**.
- The wasp, in turn, ensures **cross-pollination** of the fig flowers.

**Phenomenon:** This relationship is an example of **mutualism** — both the fig tree and the wasp benefit. The fig tree gains pollination and reproductive success, while the wasp gains a safe oviposition site and food source for its larvae. Neither organism can complete its life cycle without the other, making this an **obligate mutualistic** relationship.

### Q18.
Construct an age pyramid which reflects an expanding growth status of human population.

**Answer:**

[Diagram: A broad-based triangular age pyramid with three horizontal bars representing:
- **Pre-reproductive age group** (0–14 years) — widest bar at the base
- **Reproductive age group** (15–44 years) — medium-width bar in the middle
- **Post-reproductive age group** (45+ years) — narrowest bar at the top

The pyramid tapers progressively from bottom to top, indicating a large proportion of young individuals and a smaller proportion of old individuals — characteristic of an **expanding (growing) population**.]

```
Post-reproductive  [  ■■  ]
Reproductive       [  ■■■■■  ]
Pre-reproductive   [ ■■■■■■■■ ]
                     Expanding
```

**Explanation:** In an expanding population, the pre-reproductive age group (young individuals) is the largest, indicating a high birth rate. The pyramid has a broad base and narrow top, which is characteristic of developing countries with high population growth rates.

### Q19.
Make a list of any three outbreeding devices that flowering plants have developed and explain how they help to encourage cross-pollination.

**Answer:**

**Outbreeding devices in flowering plants:**

1. **Unisexuality (Dioecy/Monoecy):**
   - In **dioecious plants** (e.g., *Cannabis*, *Papaya*), male and female flowers are borne on separate plants, making self-pollination **impossible** and ensuring only cross-pollination (allogamy) occurs.
   - In **monoecious plants** (e.g., Maize), male and female flowers are on the same plant — this prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy.

2. **Dichogamy:**
   When the maturation of anthers (pollen release) and stigma receptivity are **not synchronized** in the same flower, self-pollination is prevented. It occurs in two forms:
   - **Protoandry:** Pollen is released **before** the stigma becomes receptive (e.g., *Salvia*, sunflower).
   - **Protogyny:** Stigma becomes receptive **before** pollen is released (e.g., *Mirabilis*).

3. **Self-Incompatibility (Self-sterility):**
   A **genetic mechanism** that prevents germination of self-pollen on the stigma of the same flower, or inhibits pollen tube growth through the style, by recognizing 'self' pollen through **S-gene products**. This ensures fertilization can only occur with pollen from a genetically different individual (e.g., *Nicotiana*, *Petunia*).

4. **Herkogamy:**
   The anthers and stigma are placed at **different positions/heights** within the same flower, so pollen cannot physically contact the stigma during self-pollination (e.g., pin and thrum flowers in *Primula*).

**OR**

Why are angiosperm anthers called dithecous? Describe the structure of its microsporangium.

**Answer:**

**Dithecous anthers:** Angiosperm anthers are called **dithecous** (di = two, thecae = cases) because each anther consists of **two lobes (thecae)**, with each lobe containing **two pollen sacs (microsporangia)**. Thus, a typical angiosperm anther has **four microsporangia** in total.

**Structure of Microsporangium:**

In a transverse section, a typical microsporangium appears **nearly circular** in outline. It is surrounded by **four wall layers:**

1. **Epidermis (outermost):** Single layer; provides protection.
2. **Endothecium:** Aids in **dehiscence** (opening) of the anther for pollen release; cells develop fibrous thickenings.
3. **Middle layers:** 2–3 layers; protective function; crushed as the anther matures.
4. **Tapetum (innermost):** Nourishes the developing **pollen grains (microspores)**; cells possess dense cytoplasm and are often **bi-nucleate or polyploid**.

The **centre** of the microsporangium is occupied by compactly arranged, homogeneous cells called **sporogenous tissue**, which undergoes meiosis to form **microspore tetrads** and ultimately **pollen grains**.

[Diagram: Transverse section of a microsporangium showing concentric layers — Epidermis (outermost), Endothecium, Middle layers, Tapetum, and Microspore mother cells (sporogenous tissue) at the centre]

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q20.
If implementation of better techniques and new strategies are required to provide more efficient care and assistance to people, then why is there a statutory ban on amniocentesis? Write the use of this technique and give reason to justify the ban.

**Answer:**

**Use of Amniocentesis:**
Amniocentesis is a **foetal sex determination and chromosomal analysis test** based on the chromosomal pattern present in the cells of the **amniotic fluid** surrounding the developing embryo. It is used to:
- Detect chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down's syndrome, Turner's syndrome)
- Identify metabolic disorders in the foetus
- Determine the sex of the foetus

**Justification for Statutory Ban:**
Despite its legitimate medical uses, amniocentesis has been **misused for sex determination** of the foetus, leading to **female foeticide** — selective abortion of female foetuses. This has caused:
- Severe skewing of the **sex ratio** (fewer females)
- Social, ethical, and demographic problems

Therefore, the Government of India has placed a **statutory ban on the use of amniocentesis for sex determination** under the **Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act**, to legally check the increasing rate of female foeticide and protect the girl child.

### Q21.
Why is pedigree analysis done in the study of human genetics? State the conclusions that can be drawn from it.

**Answer:**

**Why pedigree analysis is done:**
- In humans, **controlled experimental crosses** (as done by Mendel in pea plants) are **ethically impossible** to conduct.
- Humans have a **long generation time** and produce few offspring per mating.
- Therefore, geneticists use **pedigree analysis** — the study of family history across several generations — as an alternative approach to understand the inheritance of traits in humans.

**Conclusions that can be drawn from pedigree analysis:**
1. Whether a trait is **dominant or recessive**.
2. Whether a trait is **autosomal or sex-linked** (X-linked or Y-linked).
3. Whether an individual is a **carrier** of a recessive allele.
4. The **probability/risk** of offspring inheriting a genetic disorder in future generations.
5. The **inheritance pattern** of a specific trait, abnormality, or genetic disease (e.g., haemophilia, colour blindness, sickle-cell anaemia) across multiple generations of a family.

### Q22.
Identify 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f' in the table given below:

| No. | Syndrome | Cause | Characteristics of Affected Individuals | Sex (Male/Female/Both) |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1. | Down's | Trisomy of 21 | 'a' (i) | 'b' |
| 2. | 'c' | XXY | Overall masculine development | 'd' |
| 3. | Turner's | 45 with XO | 'e' (i) (ii) | 'f' |

**Answer:**

**a** — Characteristics of Down's syndrome individuals:
1. Short stature with small round head
2. Furrowed tongue
3. Partially open mouth
4. Broad palm with characteristic palm crease
5. Physical, psychomotor and mental development retarded (intellectual disability)

**b** — **Both** (males and females can be affected, though Down's syndrome affects individuals of both sexes; the trisomy 21 occurs in both XX and XY individuals)

**c** — **Klinefelter's Syndrome** (47, XXY)

**d** — **Male** (individuals with Klinefelter's syndrome are phenotypically male due to the presence of Y chromosome)

**e** —
(i) Sterile female with rudimentary (underdeveloped) ovaries
(ii) Lack of secondary sexual characters (short stature, webbed neck, low set ears, shield-shaped chest)

**f** — **Female** (Turner's syndrome individuals are phenotypically female, having only one X chromosome — 45, XO)

### Q23.
Community Service department of your school plans a visit to a slum area near the school with an objective to educate the slum dwellers with respect to health and hygiene.

**(a)** Why is there a need to organise such visits?

**(b)** Write the steps you will highlight, as a member of this department, in your interaction with them to enable them to lead a healthy life.

**Answer:**

**(a) Need to organise such visits:**
Slum dwellers are often unaware of basic health and hygiene practices. Their health may be adversely affected by:
- **Infections** — due to poor sanitation, contaminated water and food.
- **Lifestyle factors** — inadequate nutrition, lack of clean water, rest, and exercise.
- **Poor habitat conditions** — overcrowding, lack of proper waste disposal, and vector-breeding environments.

Educating them about health and hygiene can significantly reduce disease burden and improve quality of life.

**(b) Key points to highlight in interaction:**

1. **Importance of personal hygiene** — regular hand washing, bathing, and safe food handling practices.
2. **Safe drinking water** — use of boiled or purified water to prevent waterborne diseases.
3. **Proper waste disposal** — garbage should be disposed of in designated areas to prevent vector breeding (mosquitoes, flies, rodents).
4. **Vector control** — eliminating stagnant water (breeding grounds for mosquitoes) to prevent malaria, dengue, etc.
5. **Vaccination** — importance of immunization for children against preventable diseases (polio, measles, diphtheria, etc.).
6. **Benefits of good health** — healthy individuals are more productive at work; good health increases economic output, longevity, and reduces infant and maternal mortality.
7. **Awareness about diseases** — symptoms, prevention, and the importance of seeking timely medical help.
8. **Maintenance of a hygienic environment** — clean surroundings, proper sanitation facilities, and sewage management.

### Q24.
The following graph shows the species–area relationship. Answer the following questions as directed.

[Diagram: A graph with "Species richness" on the Y-axis and "Area" on the X-axis. Two lines are shown on a log-log scale — line 'a' (steeper slope) and line 'b' (less steep slope), both showing a positive linear relationship between log(species richness) and log(area).]

**(a)** Name the naturalist who studied the kind of relationship shown in the graph. Write the observations made by him.

**(b)** Write the situations as discovered by ecologists when the value of 'Z' (slope of the line) lies between:
- (i) 0.1 and 0.2
- (ii) 0.6 and 1.2

What does 'Z' stand for?

**(c)** When would the slope of line 'b' become steeper?

**Answer:**

**(a)** The species–area relationship was studied by **Alexander von Humboldt**. His observations:
- Within a region, **species richness increases with increasing explored area**, but only up to a limit.
- The relationship, when plotted on a **log-log scale**, gives a **straight line**, described by the equation:

$$\log S = \log C + Z \log A$$

Where $S$ = Species richness, $A$ = Area, $Z$ = slope of the line (regression coefficient), $C$ = Y-intercept.

**(b)**

- **(i) Z = 0.1 to 0.2:** This range is found when the **species–area relationship is analyzed for smaller areas**, regardless of the taxonomic group. For example, birds on small islands or plants in small plots.

- **(ii) Z = 0.6 to 1.2:** This range is found when the species–area relationship is analyzed for **very large areas**, such as **entire continents**. The steeper slope indicates that species richness increases more rapidly with area at large geographical scales.

**'Z' stands for:** The **slope of the regression line** (also called the **regression coefficient**) on a log-log plot of species richness vs. area. It indicates the rate at which species richness increases with area.

**(c)** The slope of line 'b' would become **steeper** when the **species–area relationship is analyzed over very large geographical areas**, such as entire continents, where the Z value rises to 0.6–1.2 (as opposed to 0.1–0.2 for smaller areas).

### Q25.
Name and describe the technique that helps in separating the DNA fragments formed by the use of restriction endonuclease.

**Answer:**

**Technique: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis**

**Description:**

When restriction endonucleases cut DNA, they produce fragments of different sizes. These fragments are separated by **agarose gel electrophoresis**, using the following principles and steps:

1. **Principle:** DNA molecules are **negatively charged** (due to phosphate groups in the backbone). When placed in an electric field, they migrate toward the **positive electrode (anode)**. Smaller fragments move **faster and farther**, while larger fragments move **slower and remain closer to the wells**.

2. **Procedure:**
   - An **agarose gel** is prepared and poured into an electrophoresis tank. The agarose acts as a molecular sieve.
   - DNA samples (mixed with a loading dye) are loaded into **wells** at the cathode end.
   - An electric current is applied; DNA fragments **migrate through the gel** according to their size (sieving effect).
   - After electrophoresis, the gel is stained with **ethidium bromide (EtBr)**.
   - The gel is then exposed to **UV radiation**, under which the EtBr-stained DNA bands appear as **bright orange fluorescent bands**.

3. **Result:** DNA fragments appear as distinct bands, with smaller fragments forming bands farther from the wells and larger fragments forming bands closer to the wells.

4. **Elution:** The separated bands can be **cut out from the gel** and the DNA extracted (eluted) for further use in cloning.

[Diagram: An agarose gel slab showing wells at the top (cathode end), with DNA bands migrating toward the bottom (anode end). Larger fragments are closest to the wells; smallest fragments are farthest. A size marker (DNA ladder) lane is shown on one side.]

### Q26.
State the function of a reservoir in a nutrient cycle. Explain the simplified model of carbon cycle in nature.

**Answer:**

**Function of a Reservoir in a Nutrient Cycle:**
The function of a reservoir (e.g., fossil fuels, ocean, atmosphere) is to **meet the deficit** that occurs due to an imbalance in the **rate of influx** (addition) and **efflux** (removal) of a nutrient in the active cycling pool. Reservoirs store large amounts of nutrients and release them slowly to compensate for fluctuations in the cycling process.

**Simplified Model of Carbon Cycle in Nature:**

[Diagram: Carbon cycle showing CO₂ in the atmosphere at the center, with arrows indicating:
- **Photosynthesis** by terrestrial plants and aquatic phytoplankton (absorbing CO₂)
- **Respiration and decomposition** by all organisms (releasing CO₂)
- **Burning of forests, fuelwood, and organic debris** (releasing CO₂)
- **Combustion of fossil fuels** for vehicles, electricity, and heat (releasing CO₂)
- Carbon stored in **coal, oil and gas** (fossil fuels)
- Carbon stored in **limestone and dolomite** (geological reservoirs)
- **Decay of organisms** forming calcareous sediments and organic sediments
- CO₂ dissolved in **ocean water** (aquatic reservoir)]

**Key processes in the Carbon Cycle:**

1. **Photosynthesis:** Green plants and algae fix atmospheric CO₂ into organic molecules — $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{light}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$

2. **Respiration:** All living organisms break down organic molecules and release CO₂ back into the atmosphere.

3. **Decomposition:** Decomposers (bacteria, fungi) break down dead organic matter, releasing CO₂.

4. **Combustion:** Burning of fossil fuels and biomass releases stored carbon as CO₂.

5. **Sedimentation:** Carbon gets locked in **fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)** and **carbonate rocks (limestone, dolomite)** over geological timescales — these are the major carbon **reservoirs**.

6. **Oceanic exchange:** CO₂ dissolves in ocean water and is used by aquatic plants/phytoplankton for photosynthesis; marine organisms form calcareous shells that eventually form limestone.

### Q27.
Since the origin of life on Earth, there were five episodes of mass extinction of species.

**(i)** How is the 'Sixth Extinction', presently in progress, different from the previous episodes?

**(ii)** Who is mainly responsible for the 'Sixth Extinction'?

**(iii)** List any four points that can help to overcome this disaster.

**Answer:**

**(i) Difference of the Sixth Extinction from previous episodes:**
The current (Sixth) mass extinction is **fundamentally different** from the five previous mass extinctions (which were caused by natural events like asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, climate shifts):
- The current extinction rates are estimated to be **100 to 1000 times faster** than pre-human (natural background) extinction rates.
- It is **driven primarily by human activities** rather than natural geological or astronomical events.
- It is occurring at an **unprecedented pace** in geological history.

**(ii) Responsible party:**
**Humans (Homo sapiens)** and their activities in the ecosystem are mainly responsible for the Sixth Extinction. The four main causes (**HIPPO**) are:
1. **H**abitat loss and fragmentation
2. **I**nvasion by alien (exotic) species introduction
3. **O**ver-exploitation of species
4. **C**o-extinctions (when one species goes extinct, dependent species also become extinct)

**(iii) Four measures to overcome this disaster:**
1. **Afforestation and habitat conservation** — planting trees and protecting natural habitats to prevent habitat loss.
2. **Preventing habitat loss and fragmentation** — establishing wildlife corridors and protected areas.
3. **Use of diverse species/biodiversity conservation** — conserving as many species as possible through in-situ and ex-situ methods.
4. **In-situ conservation** (e.g., biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries) and **ex-situ conservation** (e.g., zoological parks, botanical gardens, seed banks, cryopreservation) to protect endangered species.

**(b)** A couple where both husband and wife are producing functional gametes, but the wife is still unable to conceive, is seeking medical aid. Describe any one method that you can suggest to this couple to become happy parents.

**OR**

**(a)** Explain the different ways apomictic seeds can develop. Give an example of each.

**(b)** Mention one advantage of apomictic seeds to farmers.

**(c)** Draw a labelled mature stage of a dicotyledonous embryo.

**Answer (Main question):**

**(a) Site and Events of Fertilization in Humans:**

**Site:** Fertilization in humans occurs in the **ampullary-isthmic junction** of the **fallopian tube** (uterine tube).

**Events during fertilization:**

1. **Capacitation:** Sperms undergo physiological maturation (capacitation) in the female reproductive tract before they are capable of fertilizing the ovum.

2. **Contact and Acrosomal Reaction:** When a sperm comes in contact with the **zona pellucida** (outer glycoprotein layer) of the secondary oocyte, it induces the **acrosomal reaction** — the acrosome (cap-like structure on the sperm head) releases **hydrolytic enzymes** (e.g., hyaluronidase, acrosin) that help the sperm penetrate the zona pellucida.

3. **Prevention of Polyspermy:** The entry of the first sperm induces changes in the **plasma membrane** and **zona pellucida** (zona reaction) that block the entry of additional sperms, ensuring only one sperm fertilizes the egg.

4. **Completion of Meiosis II:** The penetration of the sperm triggers the **secondary oocyte** to complete its **second meiotic division** (which had been arrested at metaphase II). This produces:
   - One large **haploid ovum (ootid)**
   - One small **second polar body**

5. **Karyogamy (Fusion of nuclei):** The **haploid nucleus of the sperm** fuses with the **haploid nucleus of the ovum** to form a **diploid zygote** (2n = 46 chromosomes in humans).

6. **Activation of egg:** The zygote begins cleavage (mitotic divisions) as it moves toward the uterus.

**(b) Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART):**

Since both partners produce functional gametes but fertilization/implantation is not occurring (possibly due to blocked fallopian tubes or other structural issues), the couple can be assisted through:

**In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) followed by Embryo Transfer (ET):**
- Ova are retrieved from the wife's ovary (after hormonal stimulation) and fertilized with the husband's sperm **outside the body** (in vitro — in a Petri dish), under controlled laboratory conditions.
- The resulting **zygote/embryo** (at 8-cell stage) is then transferred into the **wife's uterus** (IVF-ET) or fallopian tube (ZIFT — Zygote Intra Fallopian Transfer) for normal development.
- This procedure is commonly known as the **test-tube baby** technique.

**Other options:**
- **ZIFT (Zygote Intra-Fallopian Transfer):** Zygote is transferred into the fallopian tube.
- **GIFT (Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer):** Both egg and sperm are transferred together into the fallopian tube to allow fertilization in vivo.

---

**Answer (OR):**

**(a) Ways in which apomictic seeds can develop:**

Apomixis is the production of seeds **without fertilization (asexual seed formation)**. The different methods include:

**1. Diplospory (Diploid Parthenogenesis):**
- The **archesporium** differentiates to form a **megaspore mother cell (MMC)**, but this MMC **directly gives rise to an embryo sac without undergoing meiosis**.
- The embryo sac is **diploid (2n)**, and a **diploid embryo** is formed from the diploid egg cell **without fertilization** (parthenogenesis).
- **Examples:** *Parthenium*, *Taraxacum* (dandelion)

$$\text{Sporophyte (2n)} \rightarrow \text{MMC (2n)} \xrightarrow{\text{without meiosis}} \text{Embryo sac (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Egg cell (2n)} \xrightarrow{\text{without fertilization}} \text{Embryo (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Seed (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Plant (2n)}$$

**2. Apospory:**
- The embryo sac (female gametophyte) is **directly formed from any diploid cell of the ovule** (nucellus or integument) **other than the megaspore mother cell**, **without meiosis**.
- The gametophyte produced is always **diploid**.
- **Examples:** *Hieracium*, *Ranunculus*, *Rubus*

$$\text{Ovule} \begin{cases} \text{Nucellus (2n)} \\ \text{Integument (2n)} \end{cases} \xrightarrow{\text{without meiosis}} \text{Embryo sac (2n)} \xrightarrow{\text{without fertilization}} \text{Embryo (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Seed (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Plant (2n)}$$

**3. Adventive Embryony:**
- An embryo is formed **directly from any diploid cell** (nucellus or integument) of the **sporophyte**, bypassing both meiosis and embryo sac formation entirely.
- This diploid cell behaves like a zygote and develops into an **adventive embryo**.
- **Examples:**
  - From nucellus: *Citrus*, *Mangifera* (mango), *Opuntia*, *Mamillaria*
  - From integuments: *Spiranthus australis*

$$\text{Nucellus/Integument (2n)} \xrightarrow{\text{without meiosis \& without fertilization}} \text{Embryo (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Seed (2n)} \rightarrow \text{Plant (2n)}$$

**Additional forms (not included in agamospermy):**
- **Parthenogenesis:** Haploid egg cell of female gametophyte forms a haploid embryo without fertilization.
- **Apogamy:** Any haploid cell (other than the egg cell) of female gametophyte forms a haploid embryo without fertilization.

**(b) Advantage of apomictic seeds to farmers:**

Apomictic seed formation **does not involve meiosis and fertilization**, so the seeds are **genetically identical to the parent plant**. If hybrid seeds become apomictic:
- They will **maintain their hybrid traits generation after generation** (no segregation of characters as meiosis is absent; no recombination as fertilization is absent).
- **Farmers do not need to purchase fresh hybrid seeds every season** (every 2–3 years), saving considerable cost.
- The **uniformity and vigour of hybrid crops** can be perpetuated indefinitely.

**(c) Labelled mature dicotyledonous embryo:**

[Diagram: A mature dicotyledonous embryo showing:
- **Plumule** (shoot apex/embryonic shoot) at the top
- **Cotyledons** (two seed leaves, one on each side) — large, fleshy storage structures

- **Root cap** covering the tip of the radicle]

### Q29.
**(a)** Describe the various steps of Griffith's experiment that led to the conclusion of the 'Transforming Principle'.

**(b)** How did the chemical nature of the 'Transforming Principle' get established?

**OR**

Describe how the lac operon operates, both in the presence and absence of an inducer in *E. coli*.

**Answer (Main question):**

**(a) Griffith's Experiment and the Transforming Principle:**

Frederick Griffith (1928) performed his experiment on *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (pneumococcus), a bacterium that causes pneumonia in mice. He used two strains:

- **Smooth (S) strain:** Capsulated, **virulent** (disease-causing), produces smooth colonies on culture media.
- **Rough (R) strain:** Non-capsulated, **avirulent** (non-disease-causing), produces rough colonies on culture media.

**Steps of the experiment:**

| Experiment | Procedure | Result |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Mice injected with **live S-strain bacteria** | Mice **died** (pneumonia) |
| 2 | Mice injected with **live R-strain bacteria** | Mice **survived** |
| 3 | Mice injected with **heat-killed S-strain bacteria** | Mice **survived** |
| 4 | Mice injected with **heat-killed S-strain + live R-strain bacteria** | Mice **died** (live S-strain bacteria recovered from dead mice) |

**Conclusion (Transforming Principle):**
From Experiment 4, Griffith concluded that the **R-strain bacteria had been transformed into virulent S-strain bacteria** by absorbing some **heat-stable material** (the "transforming principle") from the heat-killed S-strain bacteria. This transformed R bacteria acquired the ability to synthesize a polysaccharide coat and caused pneumonia. However, Griffith could not identify the chemical nature of the transforming principle.

**(b) Chemical nature of the Transforming Principle — Avery, MacLeod & McCarty Experiment (1944):**

Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty provided definitive biochemical evidence for the chemical nature of the transforming principle.

They **purified the biochemicals** (DNA, RNA, and Protein) separately from heat-killed S-strain bacteria and conducted the following experiments:

| Treatment of heat-killed S-strain extract | Transformation of R to S strain | Conclusion |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Treated with **Proteinase** (destroys protein) | Transformation **occurred** | Protein is **NOT** the transforming principle |
| Treated with **RNase** (destroys RNA) | Transformation **occurred** | RNA is **NOT** the transforming principle |
| Treated with **DNase** (destroys DNA) | Transformation **did NOT occur** | **DNA IS** the transforming principle |

$$\text{Heat-killed S extract} + \text{DNase} + \text{R bacteria} \rightarrow \text{No transformation (R bacteria only)}$$
$$\text{Heat-killed S extract} + \text{RNase} + \text{R bacteria} \rightarrow \text{Transformation occurs (S bacteria produced)}$$
$$\text{Heat-killed S extract} + \text{Proteinase} + \text{R bacteria} \rightarrow \text{Transformation occurs (S bacteria produced)}$$

**Conclusion:** Only DNase treatment inhibited transformation, proving conclusively that **DNA is the transforming principle** — i.e., DNA is the hereditary material responsible for transformation.

**Answer (OR): Lac Operon in *E. coli***

The **lac operon** is a classic example of **negative gene regulation** in *E. coli*, proposed by François Jacob and Jacques Monod (1961). It controls the metabolism of lactose.

**Components of the Lac Operon:**
- **i gene (Regulator gene):** Codes for the **lac repressor protein**.
- **Promoter (P):** Site where **RNA polymerase** binds to initiate transcription.
- **Operator (O):** Site where the **lac repressor** binds (located between promoter and structural genes).
- **Structural genes:**
  - **lacZ:** Codes for **β-galactosidase** (cleaves lactose into glucose + galactose)
  - **lacY:** Codes for **permease** (transports lactose into the cell)
  - **lacA:** Codes for **transacetylase** (acetylates certain sugars)

**1. In the ABSENCE of inducer (lactose) — Operon is OFF:**
- The regulator gene (*i*) is constitutively expressed and produces the **lac repressor protein**.
- The **lac repressor** binds to the **operator** sequence with high affinity.
- This **blocks the movement of RNA polymerase** from the promoter to the structural genes.
- Therefore, **transcription of lacZ, lacY, and lacA is inhibited** — no mRNA is produced, and no enzymes are synthesized.
- This is efficient because the bacterium does not waste energy producing lactose-metabolizing enzymes when lactose is absent.

$$\text{i gene} \rightarrow \text{Repressor protein} \rightarrow \text{binds Operator} \rightarrow \text{blocks transcription} \rightarrow \text{No } \beta\text{-galactosidase/permease/transacetylase}$$

**2. In the PRESENCE of inducer (lactose) — Operon is ON:**
- Lactose (the inducer) enters the cell and is converted to **allolactose** (the actual inducer molecule) by small amounts of β-galactosidase.
- **Allolactose binds to the lac repressor protein**, causing a **conformational change** that reduces its affinity for the operator.
- The **repressor–inducer complex dissociates from the operator** (inactivated repressor can no longer bind DNA).
- **RNA polymerase is now free** to bind the promoter and transcribe the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA).
- The resulting **mRNA is translated** into the three enzymes: β-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase.
- These enzymes metabolize lactose for energy.
- When lactose is exhausted, the repressor is no longer inactivated and re-binds the operator, turning the operon off again.

$$\text{Lactose (inducer)} \rightarrow \text{allolactose} \rightarrow \text{binds repressor} \rightarrow \text{repressor inactivated} \rightarrow \text{operator free} \rightarrow \text{RNA polymerase transcribes} \rightarrow \text{enzymes produced}$$

**Summary Table:**

| Condition | Repressor state | Operator | Transcription | Enzymes |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| No lactose | Active (binds operator) | Blocked | **OFF** | Not produced |
| Lactose present | Inactive (bound to allolactose) | Free | **ON** | Produced |

### Q30.
With advancements in genetics, molecular biology and tissue culture, new traits have been incorporated into crop plants. Explain the main steps in breeding a new genetic variety of a crop.

**OR**

**(a)** State the objective of animal breeding.

**(b)** List the importance and limitations of inbreeding. How can the limitations be overcome?

**(c)** Give an example of a new breed each of cattle and poultry.

**Answer (Main question): Steps in Breeding a New Genetic Variety of a Crop**

Plant breeding is a purposeful manipulation of plant species to create new varieties with desired characteristics. The main steps are:

**Step 1: Collection of Variability (Germplasm Collection)**
- Genetic variability is the **prerequisite** for any breeding programme.
- All wild species, cultivated varieties, and relatives of the crop are collected from different geographical regions.
- This collection of diverse alleles for all genes in a crop is called the **germplasm collection**.
- It is maintained in **gene banks/seed banks** (e.g., National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, India).

**Step 2: Evaluation and Selection of Parents**
- The entire germplasm collection is **evaluated and screened** for the desired trait(s) (e.g., disease resistance, high yield, nutritional quality).
- Plants possessing the **desired character(s)** are **selected as parents** for the hybridization programme.

**Step 3: Cross-Hybridization among Selected Parents**
- Hybridization is performed between the selected parents to **combine the desired traits** from two or more parents into a single plant.

$$P_1 \times P_2 \rightarrow F_1 \text{ (Hybrid)}$$

- This can be done between:
  - **Varieties of the same species** (intervarietal hybridization)
  - **Different species** (interspecific hybridization)
  - **Different genera** (intergeneric hybridization)

**Step 4: Selection and Testing of Superior Recombinants**
- The $F_1$ and subsequent generations are evaluated for the **presence and expression of the desired combination** of characters.
- Plants showing **superior traits** (better than both parents — transgressive segregation) are identified and selected.
- This is the most crucial and time-consuming step.
- Selected plants are self-pollinated for several generations to achieve **homozygosity** (true-breeding lines).

**Step 5: Testing, Release and Commercialization of New Cultivars**
- The selected superior lines are **evaluated in different agro-climatic conditions** for several years (multi-location trials) along with the **best available local check (standard) variety**.
- Lines are evaluated for **yield, disease resistance, quality parameters, and other agronomic traits**.
- If the new lines are found to be **superior to local check varieties**, they are recommended for release.
- Released varieties are **approved by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC)** and made available to farmers for commercial cultivation.

Germplasm Collection → Evaluation & Selection of Parents → Hybridization (P₁ × P₂ → Hybrid) → Selection of superior recombinants → Testing in multiple agro-climatic conditions → Release and commercialization by CVRC]

**Answer (OR):**

**(a) Objective of Animal Breeding:**
Animal breeding aims at:
- **Increasing the yield** of domesticated animals (e.g., milk yield in cattle, egg production in poultry, meat quality in sheep/pigs).
- **Improving the desirable qualities** of animal products (e.g., fat content of milk, quality of wool, leaner meat).
- Developing animals with **disease resistance** and ability to adapt to different climates.

**(b) Importance and Limitations of Inbreeding:**

**Importance (Merits) of Inbreeding:**
1. **Identification of superior parents:** Superior males and superior females of the same breed are identified and selected for mating.
2. **Increases homozygosity:** Inbreeding increases the proportion of homozygous loci, thereby producing **pure breeding (true-breeding) lines** with predictable traits.
3. **Exposes harmful recessive alleles:** Inbreeding brings recessive alleles into a homozygous state, making them visible in the phenotype so they can be **identified and eliminated by selection**.
4. **Accumulation of superior genes:** Favourable alleles are accumulated and maintained in the population, while less desirable genes are eliminated.
5. **Increases productivity:** Inbred populations, when true-breeding, often show consistent and improved productivity.

**Limitations (Demerits) of Inbreeding:**
1. **Inbreeding depression:** Continued and close inbreeding leads to a gradual **reduction in fertility, vigour, and productivity** of the population — this is called inbreeding depression. It results from the expression of harmful homozygous recessive alleles.

**How to overcome limitations:**
- After several generations of inbreeding, **selected inbred lines are crossed with each other** (outbreeding/outcrossing). This restores **heterozygosity** and leads to **hybrid vigour (heterosis)** — the offspring of such crosses show superior performance compared to either parent.
- **Outcrossing** (mating of animals of the same breed but with no common ancestors for 4–6 generations) and **crossbreeding** (mating of superior males of one breed with females of another breed) can counteract inbreeding depression.

**(c) Examples of New Breeds:**

- **New breed of cattle:** **Hissardale** (a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri ewes with Marino rams — note: the document states cattle but Hissardale is actually a sheep breed; for cattle, an example would be **Sunandini** or **Karan Swiss**)

- **New breed of poultry:** **Leghorn** (a high egg-producing breed of domestic fowl)
