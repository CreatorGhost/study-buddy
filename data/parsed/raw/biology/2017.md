## Section B — 2 Marks Each

### Q6.
A pollen grain in angiosperm at the time of dehiscence from an anther could be 2-celled or 3-celled. Explain. How are the cells placed within the pollen grain when shed at a 2-celled stage?

**Solution:**
- In majority of angiosperms, pollens are released in the **2-celled stage**, whereas in other species, the generative cell divides into 2 male gametes and forms the **3-celled stage**.
- When the pollen grain is shed at the 2-celled stage, it has two unequal cells:
  - A bigger **vegetative cell**
  - A smaller **generative cell**

| **Universal** | The code is the same in all organisms. |

**(b) Degenerate and Initiator:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Degenerate** | When an amino acid is coded by more than one codon, it is said to be degenerate. |
| **Initiator** | AUG is an initiator codon, i.e., it initiates the translation process and also codes for methionine. |

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q11.
(a) Can a plant flowering in Mumbai be pollinated by pollen grains of the same species growing in New Delhi? Provide explanations to your answer.

(b) Draw the diagram of a pistil where pollination has successfully occurred. Label the parts involved in reaching the male gametes to its desired destination.

**Solution:**

**(a)** Yes, it is possible by **Artificial Hybridisation**, where pollen grains of one flower are introduced artificially on the stigma of another flower. However, there should not be self-incompatibility.

- For this, in one flower, **emasculation** (removal of anthers) is done and by choice the flower is then **bagged**.
- After some time, the bag is removed and then desired pollen grains are introduced on its stigma.

**(b)**

[Diagram: A labelled diagram of a pistil showing the pollen tube growing through the style towards the ovule. Labels include: **Pollen tube**, **Antipodals**, **Polar nuclei** (inside **Embryo sac**), **Egg cell**, **Synergid**, and **2 male gametes** at the base of the pollen tube entering the ovule.]

### Q12.
Both Haemophilia and Thalassemia are blood related disorders in humans. Write their causes and the difference between the two. Name the category of genetic disorder they both come under.

**Solution:**

Both are **Mendelian disorders**.

**Haemophilia:**
- It is a **sex-linked recessive disorder**.
- The gene for haemophilia is located on the X-chromosome.
- The gene passes from a carrier female to her son.

**Thalassemia:**
- It is an **autosomal linked recessive disease**.
- It occurs due to either **mutation or deletion** resulting in a reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains of haemoglobin.

**Difference between Haemophilia and Thalassemia:**

| Haemophilia | Thalassemia |
|---|---|
| Clotting is affected; there can be non-stop bleeding even after a minor cut. | Anaemia is the characteristic feature of this disease. |

**Category:** Both are **Mendelian disorders**.

### Q13.
(a) List the two methodologies which were involved in the Human Genome Project. Mention how they were used.

(b) Expand 'YAC' and mention what it was used for.

**Solution:**

**(a) Two Methodologies of HGP:**

1. **Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs):** This method focuses on identifying all the genes that are expressed as RNA.

2. **Sequence Annotation:** It is an approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that contains all the coding and non-coding sequences, and later assigning different regions in the sequence with functions.

**(b) YAC → Yeast Artificial Chromosome:**

It is used as a **cloning vector** for cloning DNA fragments in a suitable host so that DNA sequencing can be done.

### Q17.
Secondary treatment of the sewage is also called Biological treatment. Justify this statement and explain the process.

**Solution:**

**Secondary Treatment / Biological Treatment:**

- Primary effluent is passed into large **aeration tanks** with constant mechanical agitation and air supply.
- Useful aerobic microbes grow rapidly and form **flocs**.
- Flocs are masses of bacteria that consume organic matter and thus reduce the **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**.
- When BOD of sewage has reduced, the effluent is passed into a **Settling tank**.
- Here, the bacterial flocs settle and the sediment is called **activated sludge**.
- A small part of the sludge is used as an inoculum in the aeration tank and the remaining part is passed into large tanks called **anaerobic sludge digesters**.
- In the digesters, **heterotrophic microbes** anaerobically digest bacteria and fungi in sludge, producing a mixture of gases such as methane (CH₄), H₂S and CO₂, which forms **biogas**.

---

### Q18.
(a) Explain the significance of palindromic nucleotide sequence in the formation of recombinant DNA.

(b) Write the use of restriction endonuclease in the above process.

**Solution:**

**(a)** Palindromic sequences are sequences of base pairs that read the same on both DNA strands when the orientation of reading is kept the same. For example:

$$5' \text{——GAATTC——} 3'$$
$$3' \text{——CTTAAG——} 5'$$

- Every endonuclease inspects the entire DNA sequence for a palindromic recognition sequence.

**(b)**
- On finding the palindrome, the endonuclease binds to the DNA.
- It cuts the opposite strands of DNA, but between the same bases on both strands, forming **sticky ends**.
- These sticky ends facilitate the action of the enzyme **DNA ligase** and help in the formation of **recombinant DNA**.

---

### Q19.
Describe the roles of heat, primers and the bacterium *Thermus aquaticus* in the process of PCR.

**Solution:**

**Role of Heat:**
It helps in the **denaturation** process in PCR. The double-stranded DNA is heated to a very high temperature (95°C) so that both the strands separate.

**Role of Primers:**
Primers are chemically synthesised small oligonucleotides of about **10–18 nucleotides** that are complementary to a region of template DNA and help in the extension of the new chain.

**Role of Bacterium *Thermus aquaticus*:**
From this bacterium, a **thermostable Taq DNA polymerase** is isolated which can tolerate high temperatures and forms the new strand.

---

### Q20.
Explain the various steps involved in the production of artificial insulin.

**Solution:**

**Genetically Engineered Insulin:**

- Insulin contains two short polypeptide chains: **chain A** and **chain B**, linked together by **disulphide bridges**.
- In mammals, insulin is synthesised as a **pro-hormone**. It contains an extra stretch called **C-peptide**.
- The C-peptide is absent in mature insulin and is removed during maturation.
- Production of insulin by rDNA techniques was achieved by an American company, **Eli Lilly in 1983**.
- It prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to chains A and B of human insulin and introduced them in **plasmids of *E. coli*** for production.
- The A and B chains produced were separated, extracted and combined by creating **disulphide bonds** to form human insulin.

---

### Q21.
(a) "Organisms may be conformers or regulators." Explain this statement and give one example of each.

(b) Why are there more conformers than regulators in the animal world?

**Solution:**

**(a)**

**Regulators:**
The organism is able to maintain **homeostasis** by physiological and behavioural means. All birds and mammals and a few lower vertebrates and invertebrate species maintain homeostasis by thermoregulation and osmoregulation.
- *Example:* Birds and Mammals

**Conformers:**
Majority (99%) of animals and nearly all plants cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature is not constant — they are simply conformers.
- *Example:* Fishes, Frogs

**(b)** Because conformers lack the capability to maintain a constant internal environment or homeostasis. Thermoregulation is energetically expensive, making it difficult for most organisms to afford it.

---

### Q22.
Describe the inter-relationship between productivity, gross primary productivity and net productivity.

**Solution:**

The rate of biomass production per unit area, over a time period by plants during photosynthesis is called **productivity**.

It is expressed as: $(kcal\ m^{-2})\ yr^{-1}$ or $g\ m^{-2}\ yr^{-1}$

The amount of biomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period in plants during photosynthesis is called **primary production**.

**Primary Productivity** is divided into:

| **Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)** | **Net Primary Productivity (NPP)** |
|---|---|
| It is the rate of production of organic matter during photosynthesis in an ecosystem. | It is the weight of the organic matter stored by the producers in a unit area/volume per unit time. |
| Some of GPP is utilised in respiration (R). | $NPP = GPP - R$ where $R =$ Respiration losses. |

$$NPP = GPP - R$$

## Section D — 4 Marks (Value Based Question)

### Q23.
It is commonly observed that parents feel embarrassed to discuss freely with their adolescent children about sexuality and reproduction. The result of this parental inhibition is that the children go astray sometimes.

(a) Explain the reasons that you feel are behind such embarrassment amongst some parents to freely discuss such issues with their growing children.

(b) By taking one example of a local plant and animal, how would you help these parents to overcome such inhibitions about reproduction and sexuality?

**Solution:**

**(a)** Parents feel embarrassed because:
- Indian society is not that broad-minded and parents feel shy talking openly regarding these matters to their children, due to which children sometimes go astray.
- However, parents should consider that during adolescence, they should behave like friends to their children so that the child can also share problems with them.
- Parents should give the right information about reproductive aspects, sexual practices and adolescence changes to their children so that they will never be misled.

**(b)** By giving an example of the **male honey bee** and the **orchid *Ophrys* flower**, it is evident that sexual attraction is a natural phenomenon. The honey bee is attracted to an *Ophrys* flower and assumes one of its petals as its female partner and **pseudo-copulates** with it. This shows that reproduction and sexual attraction are completely natural phenomena, and parents should be comfortable discussing these matters with their children.

## Section E — 5 Marks Each

### Q24.
(a) When a seed of an orange is squeezed, many embryos, instead of one, are observed. Explain how it is possible.

(b) Are these embryos genetically similar or different? Comment.

**OR**

(a) Explain the following phases in the menstrual cycle of a human female:
  (i) Menstrual phase
  (ii) Follicular phase
  (iii) Luteal phase

(b) A proper understanding of menstrual cycle can help immensely in family planning. Do you agree with the statement? Provide reasons for your answer.

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a)** It is due to **polyembryony**.

- Occurrence of more than one embryo in a seed is called **POLYEMBRYONY**.
- In orange, the nucellar cells, synergid or integument cells develop into a number of embryos of different sizes.
- *Example:* Citrus
- Sometimes, formation of more than one egg in an embryo sac can also lead to polyembryony.

**(b)** In such embryos, parental characters are maintained; hence they are **genetically similar**. In this process, there is **no segregation** of characters in the offspring (progeny).

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative):**

**(a)**

**(i) Menstrual phase:**
- The soft tissue of the endometrial lining of the uterus disintegrates causing bleeding.
- The unfertilised egg and soft tissues are discharged.
- It lasts for **3–5 days**.

**(ii) Follicular phase / Proliferative Phase:**
- The primary follicles in the ovary grow and become a fully mature **Graafian follicle**.
- The endometrium regenerates.
- It lasts for about **10 to 14 days**.

**(iii) Luteal phase (Days 15 to 28/29):**
- In this phase, the ruptured follicle changes into **corpus luteum** in the ovary and it begins to secrete the hormone **progesterone**.
- The endometrium thickens further.
- If the ovum is not fertilised, the corpus luteum undergoes degeneration, causing disintegration of the endometrium and leading to **menstruation**.

**(b)** Yes, a proper understanding of the menstrual cycle can help immensely in family planning because:
- Days **10 to 17** of the menstrual cycle are called the **fertile period** of the human female.
- If coitus is done during this period, it increases the chances of conception.
- If coitus is abstained during this period, pregnancy can be prevented.

### Q25.
(a) Compare, giving reasons, the J-shaped and S-shaped models of population growth of a species.

(b) Explain 'fitness of a species' as mentioned by Darwin.

**OR**

(a) What is an ecological pyramid? Compare the pyramids of energy, biomass and numbers.

(b) Write any two limitations of ecological pyramids.

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a)** There are 2 models of population growth:

**(i) Exponential Growth (J-shaped curve):**

This growth occurs where the resources (food + space) are **unlimited**. The equation can be represented as:

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = (b - d) \times N$$

Let $(b - d) = r$, then:

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \quad \text{or} \quad N_t = N_0 e^{rt}$$

Where:
- $N$ = population size
- $N_t$ = population density after time $t$
- $N_0$ = population density at time zero
- $r$ = intrinsic rate of natural increase
- $b$ = birth rate
- $d$ = death rate

When $N$ is plotted in relation to time, the curve becomes **J-shaped**.

**(ii) Logistic Growth Model (S-shaped curve):**

This is a realistic approach as resources become limited at a certain point of time. Every ecosystem has limited resources to support a particular maximum **carrying capacity (K)**.

When $N$ is plotted in relation to time $t$, a sigmoid **S-shaped curve** is obtained, also called the **Verhulst-Pearl logistic growth**. The equation is:

$$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(\frac{K - N}{K}\right)$$

Where:
- $N$ = population density at time $t$
- $r$ = growth rate
- $K$ = carrying capacity

[Diagram: Graph showing two curves plotted as Population density (N) vs Time (t). Curve (a) is J-shaped representing exponential growth with equation $\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$. Curve (b) is S-shaped representing logistic growth with equation $\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(\frac{K-N}{K}\right)$. A horizontal dashed line at K represents carrying capacity.]

**(b)** "Fitness of a species" according to Darwin means **reproductive fitness**. All organisms after reaching reproductive age have varying degrees of reproductive potential — some organisms produce more offspring and some produce only a few. This phenomenon is also called **Differential Reproduction**.

Hence, the species which produces more offspring are selected by nature (natural selection).

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative):**

**(a) Ecological Pyramid:**

The relation between producers and consumers in an ecosystem can be graphically represented in the form of a pyramid called an **ecological pyramid**.

Ecological pyramids are of 3 types:

**(i) Pyramid of Number:**

The relationship between producers and consumers in terms of **number of individuals** at each trophic level.

[Diagram: An upright pyramid with four trophic levels. From bottom to top — PP (Primary producer): 5,842,000; PC (Primary consumer): 708,000; SC (Secondary consumer): 3,54,000; TC (Tertiary consumer): 3]

**(ii) Pyramid of Biomass:**

The relationship between producers and consumers in terms of **dry weight (biomass)** (kg m⁻²) at each trophic level. It can be upright or inverted.

[Diagram: An upright pyramid with four trophic levels. From bottom to top — PP: 809 kg m⁻²; PC: 37 kg m⁻²; SC: 11 kg m⁻²; TC: 1.5 kg m⁻²]

**(iii) Pyramid of Energy:**

The relationship between producers and consumers in terms of **flow of energy** at each trophic level. It is **always upright** as energy is lost as heat at each step.

[Diagram: An upright pyramid with four trophic levels. From bottom to top — PP: 10,000 J; PC: 1000 J; SC: 100 J; TC: 10 J. The base receives 1,000,000 J of Sunlight.]

**(b) Limitations of Ecological Pyramids:**

1. It never takes into account the same species belonging to **two or more trophic levels**.
2. It assumes a **simple food chain**, which never exists in nature; it does not accommodate food webs.

### Q26.
(a) Describe the structure and function of a t-RNA molecule. Why is it referred to as an adapter molecule?

(b) Explain the process of splicing of hn-RNA in a eukaryotic cell.

**OR**

Write the different components of a *lac*-operon in *E. coli*. Explain its expression while in an 'open' state.

**Solution (Main Question):**

**(a)**

**t-RNA (transfer RNA)** reads the genetic code on one hand and transfers amino acids on the other hand, so it is called an **adapter molecule** by Francis Crick. It is also called **soluble RNA (sRNA)**.

**Structure of t-RNA:**

The secondary structure of t-RNA is **clover leaf-like** but the 3-D structure is **inverted L-shaped**. t-RNA has five arms or loops:

[Diagram: Clover-leaf structure of t-RNA showing: Amino acid acceptor end (with 'Ser' attached) at the top, D-loop on the upper left, T-loop on the upper right, Variable arm in the centre-right, Anticodon loop at the bottom with the anticodon (U-C-A) complementary to the codon (A-G-U) on m-RNA.]

| Loop/Arm | Function |
|---|---|
| **(i) Anticodon loop** | Has bases complementary to the codon on mRNA |
| **(ii) Amino acid acceptor end** | To which the amino acid binds |
| **(iii) T-loop** | Helps in binding to the ribosome |
| **(iv) D-loop** | Helps in binding aminoacyl synthetase |
| **(v) Variable loop** | No function known |

**(b) Splicing of hn-RNA:**

- The primary transcripts formed in eukaryotes are **non-functional**, containing both the coding region (**exons**) and non-coding region (**introns**) in RNA — these are called **heterogeneous RNA (hn-RNA)**.
- hn-RNA undergoes a process where the **introns are removed** and the **exons are joined** to form functional **m-RNA**.
- This process is called **SPLICING**.

**OR**

**Solution (Alternative):**

**The *lac* Operon (Inducible Operon):**

The concept of operon was first proposed in **1961 by Jacob and Monod**.

**Components of the *lac* operon:**

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **(i) Structural genes (z, y, a)** | Fragments of DNA which transcribe mRNA for polypeptide synthesis |
| **(ii) Promoter (p)** | The sequence of DNA where RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription |
| **(iii) Operator (o)** | The sequence of DNA adjacent to the promoter |
| **(iv) Regulator gene (i)** | Codes for repressor protein which binds to the operator, switching the operon **off** |
| **(v) Inducer** | Lactose is the inducer which helps in switching the operon **on** |

- **Gene z** codes for **β-galactosidase**
- **Gene y** codes for **permease**
- **Gene a** codes for **transacetylase**

**When lactose is absent (Operon switched OFF):**

[Diagram (a): Shows the lac operon arrangement: p — i — p — **o** (filled/blocked) — z — y — a. Arrow from regulatory gene produces Repressor mRNA → Repressor protein. The repressor binds to operator region (o) and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. Label: "In absence of inducer (switched off)"]

- The regulator gene (i) produces **repressor protein**.
- This repressor protein binds to the **operator** and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the operon.
- The operon is **switched off**.

**When lactose is present (Operon switched ON / 'Open' state):**

[Diagram (b): Shows the lac operon: p — i — p — o — z — y — a. Arrow from regulatory gene produces Repressor mRNA → Repressor. Inducer (lactose) binds to Repressor → Inactive repressor. RNA polymerase transcribes lac mRNA from z, y, a genes. Translation produces β-galactosidase, permease, transacetylase. Label: "In presence of inducer (Switched on)"]

- Lactose acts as an **inducer** which binds to the repressor and forms an **inactive repressor**.
- The repressor **cannot bind** to the operator.
- Now RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and transcribes **lac mRNA**.
- Lac mRNA is **polycistronic**, i.e., it produces all three enzymes: **β-galactosidase, permease and transacetylase**.
- The lac operon is **switched on**.
