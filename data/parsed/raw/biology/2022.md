### Q6(a).
Study the given graphs (X) and (Y) depicting the annual variation in solar radiation on Earth from January to December and answer the undermentioned questions:

[Diagram: Two graphs side by side.
- **Graph (X):** Solar radiation (y-axis) vs Months Jan–Dec (x-axis). The curve rises steeply to a high peak (near the dashed maximum line) and falls back — showing high but seasonally variable radiation.
- **Graph (Y):** Solar radiation (y-axis) vs Months Jan–Dec (x-axis). The curve rises to a high peak (reaching the dashed maximum line) and falls symmetrically — showing high radiation reaching maximum in mid-year with greater seasonal variation.]

**(i) Identify the graph that depicts (I) tropical region, and (II) temperate region, respectively.**

**Answer:**
- **Graph (X)** depicts the **tropical region** due to its higher and more consistent solar radiation throughout the year.
- **Graph (Y)** depicts the **temperate region**, which shows greater variation in solar radiation throughout the year.

---

**(ii) Which of the two regions, (X) or (Y), will show high biological diversity and why? Give two reasons.**

**Answer:**
**Region (X) (Tropical region)** will show high biological diversity because:
1. The **consistent high solar radiation** supports year-round photosynthesis, leading to higher productivity and more food resources.
2. The **stable, warm temperatures** throughout the year promote diverse and complex ecosystems with more ecological niches.

---

**OR**

### Q6(b).

**(i) When prickly pear cactus was introduced into Australia in the early 1920s, it caused havoc and ecosystem instability by achieving very high population densities. Explain the reason for its rapid spread into millions of hectares of rangeland.**

**Answer:**
The prickly pear cactus spread rapidly due to the **absence of natural predators and pests** in the new (Australian) environment, allowing it to grow unchecked and outcompete native vegetation without any biological control.

---

**(ii) State the importance of 'prey-predator' relationship in a habitat.**

**Answer:**
The prey-predator relationship is crucial for:
1. **Maintaining ecological balance** by controlling the population sizes of species, which helps prevent overgrazing or depletion of resources.

### Q7.
When *Plasmodium* sp. (malarial parasite) enters the human body, it reproduces asexually and increases its number. During this course, the affected person suffers from malaria. After a number of asexual cycles, the parasite, in order to complete its life cycle, enters the sexual phase of its life. Trace the sexual stages in the life cycle of *Plasmodium* in a female *Anopheles* mosquito when it bites an infected person, up to the formation of mature infective stages of the parasite.

**Answer:**
The sexual stages in the life cycle of *Plasmodium* in a female *Anopheles* mosquito are as follows:

1. When a female *Anopheles* mosquito bites an infected person, it **ingests gametocytes** present in the blood.
2. These gametocytes **develop into gametes** (male microgametes and female macrogametes) in the mosquito's gut.
3. **Fertilization** occurs between the gametes, forming a **zygote**.
4. The zygote develops into a motile **ookinete**.
5. The ookinete **penetrates the gut wall** and becomes an **oocyst**.
6. The oocyst undergoes **sporogony**, dividing to produce thousands of **sporozoites**.
7. The sporozoites **migrate to the salivary glands** of the mosquito, where they become the mature infective stage, ready to infect a new human host when the mosquito bites again.

### Q8.

**(a) Name and state the type of immunity that acts as a 'biological shield' to the developing fetus against many infections in the mother's womb.**

**Answer:**
**Passive immunity** acts as a 'biological shield' to the developing fetus. It involves the **transfer of ready-made antibodies** from the mother to the fetus through the **placenta**, providing protection against infections without the fetus having to produce its own antibodies.

---

**(b) A large proportion of infants remain free from potent infections at least three months after birth, or even longer if breastfed. Explain, giving suitable reasons.**

**Answer:**
Infants remain free from infections due to:
1. The **continued presence of maternal antibodies** received through the placenta during gestation, which persist in the infant's bloodstream for several months after birth.
2. **Additional antibodies** (especially IgA) provided by **breast milk (colostrum)** during breastfeeding, which further enhances the infant's immune defences and provides prolonged protection.

---

### Q9.
With the advent of sophisticated techniques of genetic engineering, we can now readily purify and isolate DNA. Name and explain the different steps involved in the separation and isolation of DNA fragments once cut by restriction endonucleases.

**Answer:**
The steps involved in the separation and isolation of DNA fragments are:

1. **Gel Electrophoresis:**
   Load the DNA fragments onto an **agarose gel** and apply an electric current. Since DNA is negatively charged, it migrates toward the positive electrode. Fragments separate based on size — **smaller fragments move faster** and travel farther through the gel.

2. **Staining:**
   Visualize the DNA fragments by staining the gel with a **DNA-binding dye** such as **ethidium bromide** or SYBR Green, which **fluoresce under UV light**, making the bands visible.

3. **Gel Extraction:**
   The desired DNA band is **excised from the gel** using a clean scalpel under UV illumination.

4. **Purification:**
   The excised gel slice is processed using a **gel extraction kit**, which involves dissolving the gel slice and isolating the purified DNA from the solution.

### Q10(a).
"Some species in an ecosystem exert greater influence in driving major ecosystem services than others." How did Paul Ehrlich explain this concept in his 'rivet popper hypothesis'?

**Answer:**
Paul Ehrlich's **"rivet popper hypothesis"** explains the importance of biodiversity using the analogy of an **airplane held together by rivets**:

- Each **species** in an ecosystem is compared to a **rivet** in an airplane.
- Each species (rivet) plays a role in maintaining the **stability and functionality** of the ecosystem (airplane).
- **Removing a few rivets** (losing a few species) may not immediately affect the plane's flight (ecosystem functioning), but as more rivets are removed, the **structure weakens**, risking catastrophic failure.
- Similarly, the **loss of some species** may not have an immediate visible impact, but the **cumulative loss of biodiversity** eventually disrupts essential ecosystem services, leading to **ecosystem collapse**.

This hypothesis highlights the **critical importance of each species** in sustaining ecological balance and functionality, even if some species seem less significant than others.

**OR**

### Q10(b).

**(i) How has the introduction of Nile Perch into Lake Victoria in East Africa had a devastating effect on the indigenous species in the lake?**

**Answer:**
The introduction of **Nile Perch** (*Lates niloticus*) into Lake Victoria led to the **decline and extinction of many indigenous fish species** (particularly cichlid fish) in the lake due to:
- **Predation** — Nile Perch actively preyed upon the native fish species.
- **Competition** — It competed aggressively for the same food resources, outcompeting the indigenous species.

---

**(ii) Name two invasive weed species which have posed a threat to the existence of our native species.**

**Answer:**
Two invasive weed species are:
1. *Parthenium hysterophorus* (Congress grass / Carrot weed)
2. *Lantana camara*

---

### Q11.
Given below is a picture of a natural large habitat that is being continuously broken into smaller patches. This process is continuing, increasing, and expanding over time due to human impact, thereby posing a great risk to the existence of species in the habitat.

[Diagram: Three sequential images showing progressive habitat fragmentation.
- Image 1: Original Habitat — a large, intact forested area.
- Image 2: The same habitat broken into several patches with gaps between them.
- Image 3: Further fragmentation with more gaps created over time due to human activities, resulting in smaller, isolated patches.
Caption: "Habitat loss due to creation of 'patches' in a habitat"]

**(a) Do you agree with the above statement? Give two suitable reasons in support of your answer.**

**Answer:**
**Yes, I agree.** Habitat fragmentation poses a great risk to species because:
1. It **reduces the available living space and resources** for species, leading to smaller, isolated populations that are more vulnerable to extinction (reduced carrying capacity).
2. It **disrupts migration patterns and breeding opportunities**, reducing gene flow between populations and thereby decreasing **genetic diversity**, making species more susceptible to disease and environmental changes.

---

**(b) Write the ecological term used for such patches formed in an original habitat.**

**Answer:**
The ecological term for such patches is **"habitat fragments"** and the process is called **"habitat fragmentation."**

### Q12.
An application of biotechnology in agriculture involves the production of pest-resistant plants using 'cry' genes from a bacterium. Name the bacterium. Explain why the 'cry' gene kills the pest but not the bacterium itself.

**Answer:**
The bacterium used is ***Bacillus thuringiensis*** (*Bt*).

**Why the 'cry' gene kills the pest but not the bacterium itself:**

- The 'cry' gene produces **Cry proteins (crystal proteins/delta endotoxins)**, which are **toxic to certain insects** when ingested.
- In the **alkaline environment** of the insect's midgut, these proteins are **activated** (converted from inactive protoxin to active toxin) and **bind to specific receptors** in the gut lining.
- This binding **creates pores** in the gut epithelium, disrupting cell function, causing lysis of gut cells and ultimately the **death of the insect**.
- The bacterium itself is **not affected** because:
  1. It **lacks the specific gut receptors** required for the Cry protein to bind and act.
  2. It does **not have the alkaline gut conditions** needed to activate the Cry protein.
  3. *Bacillus thuringiensis* naturally produces these proteins in an **inactive protoxin form** (as crystalline inclusions), ensuring it remains unharmed.

### Q13(a).
Development of recombinant DNA technology has opened gates to many breakthroughs in the fields of medicine and agriculture. This has enabled scientists to isolate, sequence and manipulate individual genes obtained from diverse living or dead cells. Given below is a diagram showing the basic steps involved in genetically modifying an organism. Study the given diagram and answer the questions that follow: *(5 × 1 = 5)*

[Diagram: Flowchart of genetic modification steps.
- Step ①: Restriction Enzyme cuts the Gene of Interest (foreign DNA).
- Step ②: Restriction Enzyme cuts the Plasmid (Vector).
- Step (X): The cut gene of interest and cut plasmid are joined together.
- Step ③: Recombinant DNA (rDNA) (vector) is formed — shown as a circular plasmid containing the gene of interest.
- Step ④: The rDNA is introduced into *E. coli*.
- Step ⑤ / (Y): Transformed *E. coli* cells multiply, producing multiple copies of the foreign DNA — shown as multiple bacterial colonies.]

---

**(i) Are two different types of restriction endonucleases used, one to cut the vector DNA and another to cut the desired DNA to be cloned? Support your answer, giving a reason.**

**Answer:**
**No**, the **same restriction endonuclease** is used to cut both the vector DNA and the desired (foreign) DNA.

**Reason:** Using the same enzyme ensures that both the vector and the insert DNA produce **complementary sticky ends** (single-stranded overhangs with complementary base sequences), which can then be **easily joined (ligated)** together by DNA ligase to form recombinant DNA.

---

**(ii) Which enzyme is used at step (X) to integrate the foreign DNA with the vector DNA?**

**Answer:**
**DNA ligase** is used at step (X) to integrate (join/seal) the foreign DNA with the vector DNA by forming **phosphodiester bonds** between the complementary sticky ends.

---

**(iii) What is the term used for step (Y) showing multiple copies of the foreign DNA being formed in transformed *E. coli*?**

**Answer:**
The term used for step (Y) is **"gene cloning"** (or **clonal propagation / molecular cloning**).

---

**(iv) Draw a diagram of *E. coli* cloning vector pBR322 to show the following:**
- **(I) Any one restriction endonuclease site in tetracycline resistance gene.**
- **(II) Any one restriction endonuclease site in ampicillin resistance gene.**
- **(III) 'ori' site.**

**Answer:**

[Diagram: Circular map of plasmid pBR322 (4,361 bp).
- The plasmid is drawn as a circle.
- **Tetracycline resistance gene (Tet$^R$):** Located on the right side of the circle. Restriction site **BamHI** is marked within this gene (top right). **PvuII** is also marked within the Tet$^R$ gene (bottom right).

- **EcoRI** site is marked at the top of the plasmid (between the two genes).
- **Origin of replication (ori):** Marked at the bottom of the plasmid circle.
- The plasmid label "pBR322 (4,361 bp)" is shown in the centre.]

---

**(v) What does 'rop' code for in plasmid pBR322?**

**Answer:**
The **'rop'** gene codes for the **ROM (Repressor of Primer) protein**, which is involved in **regulating the replication of the plasmid** — specifically helping to control and regulate the **copy number** of the plasmid within the host cell.

---

**OR**

### Q13(b).
RNA interference (RNAi) holds great potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of human diseases and as a biocontrol agent for controlling pests in agricultural fields. An experiment was conducted to study the use of RNAi for the potential treatment of disorders of cholesterol metabolism. Some people possess genetic mutations with elevated levels of 'ApoB' gene which predisposes them to coronary artery diseases.

Lowering the amount of 'ApoB' can reduce the number of lipoproteins and lower blood cholesterol.

Tracy Zimmerman and her colleagues used RNAi in 2006 to reduce the level of 'ApoB' in non-human primates — *Cynomolgus* monkeys:
- **(i)** One group of monkeys were given RNAi treatment (Small interfering RNAs, siRNAs at 1 mg/kg).
- **(ii)** Second group of monkeys were given RNAi treatment (doses 2–5 mg/kg siRNAs).
- **(iii)** Third group of monkeys were injected saline as control.

The results of the experiments are illustrated in the graph given below:

[Diagram: Bar graph showing "Relative serum cholesterol (% per dose)" on the y-axis (0–120%) and "Time (hours)" on the x-axis (24, 48, 144, 264 hours).
Three groups of bars at each time point:
- **Saline X** (light/hatched bars): remains consistently high (~80–100%) across all time points.
- **1 mg/kg Y** (medium/hatched bars): shows moderate reduction, intermediate values.
- **2–5 mg/kg Z** (dark/solid bars): shows the greatest reduction in cholesterol levels, especially at 144 and 264 hours, with values dropping to approximately 40% or lower.
Legend: Saline X | 1 mg/kg Y | 2·5 mg/kg Z]

---

**(i) What do you interpret from the bars (X and Z) obtained after 264 hours of treatment of monkeys with saline and 2–5 mg/kg siRNAs treatment?**

**Answer:**
From the graph, after 264 hours:
- **Bar X (Saline control):** The relative serum cholesterol level remains **high** (approximately 80–100%), indicating no reduction in cholesterol.
- **Bar Z (2–5 mg/kg siRNA treatment):** The relative serum cholesterol level is **significantly lower** (approximately 40% or below), indicating a substantial reduction.

**Interpretation:** The RNAi treatment using **2–5 mg/kg siRNAs was effective** in significantly reducing serum cholesterol levels by silencing the 'ApoB' gene, compared to the saline control where no reduction was observed. This demonstrates the therapeutic potential of RNAi in treating cholesterol metabolism disorders.

---

**(ii) Name the category of organisms in the living world, where RNA interference (RNAi) takes place. Why?**

**Answer:**
RNA interference (RNAi) occurs in **eukaryotic organisms**.

**Reason:** RNAi is a natural cellular process found in eukaryotes because they possess the necessary molecular machinery (such as the enzymes **Dicer** and **Argonaute** proteins, and the **RISC complex**) required to process dsRNA into siRNAs and execute gene silencing. It functions as a mechanism to **regulate gene expression** and provide **defence against viral infections** and transposable elements.

---

**(iii) What is the basic principle involved in RNA interference (RNAi) in silencing the preferred genes?**

**Answer:**
The basic principle of RNA interference (RNAi) involves the following steps:

1. **Introduction of dsRNA:** Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) complementary to the target gene's mRNA is introduced into the cell (either naturally or experimentally).
2. **Processing by Dicer:** The enzyme **Dicer** (an RNase III enzyme) cleaves the long dsRNA into short fragments of approximately **21–23 nucleotides** called **small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)**.
3. **RISC formation:** The siRNAs are incorporated into a multi-protein complex called the **RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC)**.
4. **mRNA degradation:** The RISC uses the siRNA as a guide to **recognise and bind to the complementary target mRNA**.
5. **Gene silencing:** The bound mRNA is **cleaved and degraded**, thereby **silencing the expression** of the target gene and preventing translation of the corresponding protein.
