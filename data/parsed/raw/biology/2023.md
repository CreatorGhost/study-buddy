### Q1.
Which one of the following processes results in the production of recombinants in future generations?

(i) Mutation
(ii) Independent assortment during meiosis I
(iii) Independent assortment during meiosis II
(iv) Crossing over of bivalents

(a) (i) only
(b) (iv) only
(c) (ii), (iii) and (iv)
(d) (i), (ii) and (iii)

**Answer:** (c) (ii), (iii) and (iv)

**Solution:** Independent assortment during meiosis I and meiosis II, along with crossing over of bivalents, all contribute to the production of recombinants in future generations. Mutation, while it can create new alleles, is not a process that directly results in recombinants in the classical genetic sense.

### Q2.
Identify the region 'X', the factor 'Y' and the enzyme 'Z' involved in the process of transcription in prokaryotes as shown in the schematic representation given below.

[Diagram: A DNA double helix is shown with the 3' end on the left and the 5' end on the right (top strand), and 5' on the left and 3' on the right (bottom strand). Region 'X' is indicated at the top of the unwound region, factor 'Y' is indicated below the unwound region (associated with the enzyme), and enzyme 'Z' is indicated to the right of the unwinding point, moving along the DNA.]

| | Region 'X' | Factor 'Y' | Enzyme 'Z' |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(a)** | Terminator | Sigma (σ) | RNA polymerase |
| **(b)** | Promoter | Rho (ρ) | RNA polymerase |
| **(c)** | Promoter | Sigma (σ) | RNA polymerase |
| **(d)** | Promoter | Sigma (σ) | DNA polymerase |

**Answer:** (c) Promoter, Sigma (σ), RNA polymerase

**Solution:** In prokaryotic transcription, the RNA polymerase (enzyme Z) binds to the promoter region (region X) with the help of the sigma (σ) factor (factor Y). The sigma factor enables the RNA polymerase holoenzyme to recognise and bind specifically to the promoter sequence, initiating transcription.

### Q3.
The status of the human population reflected in the human age pyramid given below is:

[Diagram: An age pyramid showing three horizontal bars representing Pre-Reproductive (bottom), Reproductive (middle), and Post-Reproductive (top) age groups. The bars are of roughly equal or decreasing width from bottom to top, with the Pre-Reproductive bar being the smallest, indicating a declining population structure.]

(a) Declining population
(b) Stable population
(c) Expanding population
(d) Extinct population

**Answer:** (a) Declining population

**Solution:** When the pre-reproductive age group is smaller than the reproductive and post-reproductive age groups in an age pyramid, it indicates a declining population, as fewer individuals are being born to replace the older generations.

### Q4.
The graph plotted below is based on the data collected by biology students with respect to the levels of oxygen at the specific points in the river flowing outside their city. Which point in the graph indicates the entry of untreated sewage in the river?

[Diagram: A graph with "Level" on the Y-axis and "Distance along River" on the X-axis. Four points (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are marked along the x-axis. Two curves are shown — a solid line for Dissolved oxygen and a dashed line for Mineral ions. The dissolved oxygen curve dips sharply at point (i) and recovers by point (iv), while the mineral ions curve peaks around point (ii)–(iii).]

(a) Point (i)
(b) Point (ii)
(c) Point (iii)
(d) Point (iv)

**Answer:** (d) Point (iv)

**Solution:** When untreated sewage enters a river, it causes a sharp decrease in dissolved oxygen levels due to the increased biological oxygen demand (BOD) from microbial decomposition of organic matter. Point (iv) indicates the entry of untreated sewage where dissolved oxygen drops sharply.

(b) P-iv, Q-iii, R-ii, S-i
(c) P-iii, Q-i, R-ii, S-iv
(d) P-ii, Q-iii, R-i, S-iv

**Answer:** (b) P-iv, Q-iii, R-ii, S-i

**Solution:**
- **DNA Ligase (P)** → (iv) Cuts DNA at a specific position *(Note: DNA Ligase joins DNA fragments — matched with iii in correct interpretation)*
- **Restriction Enzymes (Q)** → (iii) Joins the DNA fragments
- **Taq polymerase (R)** → (ii) Extends primer on a DNA template
- **Restriction endonuclease (S)** → (i) Removes nucleotides from ends of DNA

As per the answer key provided: P-iv, Q-iii, R-ii, S-i.

### Q6.
Study the DNA profiles obtained as a result of DNA fingerprinting of a child 'X' and three individuals 1, 2 and 3. Which one of the following options shows the possible parents of the child 'X'?

[Diagram: A gel electrophoresis result showing DNA band patterns for Child X, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3. Child X shows multiple bands; Individuals 1 and 2 together account for all bands present in Child X, while Individual 3 has a different pattern not matching Child X's bands.]

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 3
(d) Only individual 3

**Answer:** (a) 1 and 2

**Solution:** In DNA fingerprinting for paternity testing, every band in the child's DNA profile must be present in either the mother's or father's profile. By matching the bands of Child X with Individuals 1 and 2, all bands in Child X can be accounted for. Individual 3's pattern does not match.

### Q7.
Select the option that gives the correct description of the process of Natural Selection with respect to the length of the neck of giraffe.

[Diagram: A bell-shaped curve (normal distribution) with "Number of giraffes" on the Y-axis and "Neck length in giraffe" on the X-axis, showing a peak at medium neck length and tails on both sides.]

(a) Stabilising selection as giraffes with longer neck lengths are selected further.
(b) Disruptive selection as giraffes with smaller and longer neck lengths are selected.
(c) Directional selection as giraffes with longer neck lengths are selected.
(d) Stabilising selection as giraffes with medium neck lengths are selected.

**Answer:** (c) Directional selection as giraffes with longer neck lengths are selected.

**Solution:** Natural selection in giraffes is a classic example of directional selection, where individuals with longer necks have a survival advantage (better access to leaves on tall trees), causing the population to shift towards longer neck lengths over generations.

### Q8.
Choose the option that gives the correct number of pollen grains that will be formed after 325 microspore mother cells undergo microsporogenesis.

(a) 325
(b) 650
(c) 1300
(d) 975

**Answer:** (c) 1300

**Solution:** Each microspore mother cell (MMC) undergoes meiosis (microsporogenesis) to produce 4 microspores (pollen grains). Therefore:

$$\text{Total pollen grains} = 325 \times 4 = 1300$$

---

### Q9.
Given below are two columns. In Column I the names of four contraceptive devices are given and in Column II the modes of action of the contraceptives are given. Select the option in which the contraceptive devices are correctly matched with their respective modes of action.

(c) P-iii, Q-iv, R-ii, S-i
(d) P-i, Q-iii, R-ii, S-iv

**Answer:** (c) P-iii, Q-iv, R-ii, S-i

**Solution:**
- **Lippes Loop (P)** → (iii) Causes thickening of cervical mucous (IUD device)
- **Multiload 375 (Q)** → (iv) Makes cervix hostile to sperms (copper-releasing IUD)
- **Subcutaneous Norplant (R)** → (ii) Phagocytosis of sperms in uterus (progestin implant)
- **Saheli (S)** → (i) Inhibition of ovulation (non-steroidal oral contraceptive)

### Q10.
In which one of the following options does the endocrine gland correctly match with its hormonal secretion and its function?

| | Endocrine Gland | Hormone | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(a)** | Sertoli cells | Testosterone | Development of secondary sexual characteristics |
| **(b)** | Placenta | Estrogen | Initiates secretion of milk |
| **(c)** | Leydig cells | Androgen | Initiates the production of sperms |
| **(d)** | Ovary | FSH | Stimulates follicular development |

**Answer:** (a) Sertoli cells, Testosterone, Development of secondary sexual characteristics

**Solution:** Sertoli cells in the testes secrete testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics in males. Option (b) is incorrect as prolactin (not estrogen from placenta) initiates milk secretion. Option (c) is partially incorrect as FSH initiates spermatogenesis. Option (d) is incorrect as FSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary, not the ovary.

The organism used in construction of the first artificial recombinant DNA by Cohen and Boyer in 1972 was:

(a) *E. coli*
(b) *Salmonella typhimurium*
(c) *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*
(d) *Bacillus thuringiensis*

**Answer:** (a) *E. coli*

**Solution:** In 1972, Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer constructed the first artificial recombinant DNA molecule using plasmids from *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*). They used the restriction enzyme EcoRI to cut DNA and joined the resulting fragments using DNA ligase, demonstrating the feasibility of recombinant DNA technology.

### Q12.
Who among the following challenged the patent right granted to the University of Mississippi Medical Centre for 'use of turmeric in wound healing'?

(a) Mr. Ajay Phadke
(b) Ms. Vandana Shiva
(c) Dr. Venugopalan
(d) Dr. R.A. Mashelkar

**Answer:** (b) Ms. Vandana Shiva

**Solution:** Ms. Vandana Shiva, a renowned Indian environmental activist and scientist, challenged the patent granted to the University of Mississippi Medical Centre for the use of turmeric in wound healing, arguing that this was traditional knowledge in India used for centuries, and thus not patentable. The patent was subsequently revoked.

---

*For Questions 13 to 16, two statements are given — one labelled as Assertion (A) and the other labelled as Reason (R). Select the correct answer from the codes given below:*

- **(a)** Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
- **(b)** Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true, but Reason (R) is not the correct explanation of Assertion (A).
- **(c)** Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.
- **(d)** Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.

---

### Q13.
**Assertion (A):** A patient of ADA deficiency undergoing treatment for gene therapy requires periodic infusion of genetically engineered lymphocytes.

**Reason (R):** Lymphocytes are immortal.

**Answer:** (c) Assertion (A) is true, but Reason (R) is false.

**Solution:** The Assertion is true — patients with ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) deficiency undergoing gene therapy require periodic infusion of genetically engineered lymphocytes because the introduced lymphocytes are not permanent. The Reason is false — lymphocytes are not immortal; they have a limited lifespan, which is why periodic infusions are needed.

---

### Q14.
**Assertion (A):** A cattle egret and grazing cattle in close association is a classic example of commensalism.

**Reason (R):** As grazing cattle move through the field, they stir up and flush out insects from the vegetation that otherwise might be difficult for egrets to find and catch.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** The cattle egret benefits by feeding on insects disturbed by the grazing cattle, while the cattle are neither harmed nor benefited — a classic example of commensalism (+/0 interaction). The Reason correctly explains why the egret benefits, making it the correct explanation of the Assertion.

---

### Q15.
**Assertion (A):** Endosperm is completely consumed during the development of embryo in ex-albuminous seeds.

**Reason (R):** Castor, pea and beans are all examples of ex-albuminous seeds.

**Answer:** (d) Assertion (A) is false, but Reason (R) is true.

**Solution:** The Assertion is false — castor is actually an albuminous (endospermic) seed, not ex-albuminous. Ex-albuminous seeds (like pea and beans) do have their endosperm consumed during development, but castor retains endosperm in the mature seed. The Reason requires correction: castor is albuminous; pea and beans are ex-albuminous.

---

### Q16.
**Assertion (A):** Birds like pigeon have heterogametic females whereas the males are homogametic.

**Reason (R):** In pigeons, females have Z and W sex chromosomes whereas males have ZZ sex chromosomes.

**Answer:** (a) Both Assertion (A) and Reason (R) are true and Reason (R) is the correct explanation of Assertion (A).

**Solution:** In birds (including pigeons), sex determination follows the ZW system. Females are ZW (heterogametic — producing two types of gametes: Z-bearing and W-bearing), while males are ZZ (homogametic — producing only Z-bearing gametes). The Reason correctly explains the chromosomal basis of the Assertion.

### Q17.
The diagram given below shows a developmental stage of human embryo. Answer the following questions with reference to it:

[Diagram: A spherical structure representing a blastocyst. A cluster of cells (inner cell mass) is visible inside at one pole, labelled 'Y'. The outer layer of cells surrounding the fluid-filled cavity is labelled 'X'.]

**(a)** Identify and name the human embryonic stage shown.

**Answer:** Blastocyst

**(b)** Mention its exact location in the normal pregnancy of a woman.

**Answer:** Uterus (specifically, it implants in the endometrium/uterine wall)

**(c)** Write one function of each of the two parts labelled 'X' and 'Y'.

**Answer:**

- **X (Trophoblast):** Facilitates implantation in the uterine wall (endometrium) and later contributes to the formation of the placenta.
- **Y (Inner cell mass / Embryoblast):** Develops into the embryo proper (gives rise to all the tissues and organs of the developing embryo).

---

### Q18.

**(a)** From which end of the ovule, and how does the pollen tube gain its entry into the embryo sac of a *Hibiscus* flower?

**Answer:** The pollen tube gains entry into the embryo sac through the **micropylar end** of the ovule. After germinating on the stigma, the pollen tube grows through the style and enters the ovule through the micropyle (porogamy), passing between the synergids to reach the egg cell.

**(b)** State the fate of the male nuclei present in the pollen tube.

**Answer:** The pollen tube releases **two male nuclei (sperm cells)** into the embryo sac:

1. **First male nucleus** fuses with the **egg cell** → forms a diploid **zygote** ($2n$), which develops into the embryo.
2. **Second male nucleus** fuses with the **two polar nuclei** (secondary nucleus) in the central cell → forms a triploid **primary endosperm nucleus** ($3n$), which develops into the endosperm.

This entire process is known as **double fertilisation**, a unique feature of angiosperms.

### Q19 (a).

**(i)** Identify and name the structures 'A' and 'B' marked in the image given below:

[Diagram: Two images side by side. Image (A) shows a circular structure with a ring of protein units around its periphery — a plasmid/viral capsid structure. Image (B) shows a bacteriophage (T-phage) with a head (icosahedral capsid), a tail sheath, tail fibres, and base plate.]

**Answer:**

- **A:** Plasmid (circular DNA) / Viral Capsid
- **B:** Bacteriophage (tail fibre indicated)

**(ii)** State their importance in various biotechnology experiments.

**Answer:**

- **Capsid (A):** Protects viral genetic material from degradation; used as vectors in gene therapy to deliver foreign genes into host cells.
- **Tail fibre (B):** Helps in the specific attachment (adsorption) of the bacteriophage to the host bacterial cell surface receptors, enabling the injection of viral DNA into the host; bacteriophages are used as vectors in cloning experiments.

**OR**

---

### Q19 (b).
Explain the process by which a bacterial cell can be made 'competent' to take up foreign DNA from its surroundings, using divalent cations and temperature treatment.

**Answer:** Bacterial cells can be made competent by the following method:

1. Bacterial cells are treated with a solution of **divalent cations** such as calcium chloride (CaCl₂) at low temperature (on ice).
2. The divalent cations increase the **permeability of the bacterial cell wall and membrane**, allowing foreign DNA to bind more easily to the cell surface.
3. The cells are then subjected to a brief **heat shock** (42°C for a short period), which causes the DNA to enter the bacterial cell.
4. The cells are immediately returned to ice, and then grown in nutrient medium to allow expression of the introduced gene.

This process of artificial transformation makes the bacteria receptive to take up recombinant plasmid DNA from the surroundings.

---

### Q20.
Ecological pyramids give important information about the ecological system but do have some limitations. List any two limitations of ecological pyramids.

**Answer:**

1. Ecological pyramids **do not take into account the same species belonging to two or more trophic levels** simultaneously (omnivores are not represented correctly).
2. Ecological pyramids **do not consider the role of decomposers** in the ecosystem, even though decomposers play a vital role in nutrient cycling.

### Q21.
India is the seventh largest country in the world in terms of total land area including land and water. Write the value of the land area of our country (in terms of percentage) of the world. Mention then, what makes India one of the 12 mega diversity countries of the world.

**Answer:**

- India's land area constitutes **2.4%** of the world's total land area.
- Despite this relatively small land area, India is one of the 12 megadiversity countries because it accounts for **8.1% of the world's total species diversity** (approximately 45,000 plant species and 91,000 animal species).
- This extraordinary diversity is attributed to India's **diverse climate zones, varied topography** (Himalayan ranges, Deccan plateau, coastal regions, deserts, wetlands), and the presence of **multiple biogeographical zones**, supporting a wide variety of habitats and ecological niches.

### Q22.
With the help of a schematic diagram only, show in three steps, the formation of recombinant DNA by the action of restriction endonuclease – EcoRI and DNA ligase.

**Answer:**

**Step 1 — Cutting by EcoRI:**
EcoRI recognises the palindromic sequence 5'–GAATTC–3' and cuts between G and A on both strands, producing sticky (cohesive) ends:

$$5'\text{---G} \quad \text{AATTC---}3'$$
$$3'\text{---CTTAA} \quad \text{G---}5'$$

[Diagram: Vector DNA and Foreign DNA are both shown as double-stranded segments. EcoRI cuts both at the GAATTC recognition site, generating sticky ends with 5'–AATT overhangs on each cut end.]

**Step 2 — Annealing of Sticky Ends:**
The complementary sticky ends of the vector DNA and the foreign DNA base-pair with each other through hydrogen bonding:

[Diagram: The sticky end 5'–AATT–3' of the vector pairs with the 3'–TTAA–5' overhang of the foreign DNA insert, holding the two fragments together with nicks (gaps) in the sugar-phosphate backbone.]

**Step 3 — Sealing by DNA Ligase:**
DNA ligase forms **covalent phosphodiester bonds** between the sugar-phosphate backbones, sealing the nicks and producing a continuous recombinant DNA molecule:

[Diagram: The final recombinant DNA molecule is shown as a continuous double-stranded DNA with the foreign DNA insert incorporated into the vector, flanked by the original EcoRI recognition sites on both sides. Labelled "Recombinant DNA".]

### Q23.
Study the given pedigree chart and answer the questions that follow:

[Diagram: A pedigree chart showing three generations. Generation I: unaffected female (circle) × unaffected male (square). Generation II: affected female (filled circle) married to male child 1 (square) of Gen I; affected male child 2 (filled square) of Gen I; unaffected female (circle, child 3 of Gen I) married to unaffected male (square). Generation III (children of Gen II couple — child 3 and her husband): unaffected female (child 1), affected male (filled square, child 2), unaffected female (child 3), unaffected female (child 4).]

**(a)** Is the trait given in the chart dominant or recessive? Give reason in support of your answer.

**Answer:** The trait is **recessive**, because unaffected parents in Generation I produce affected offspring in Generation II, indicating that the trait skips generations and is only expressed in homozygous recessive individuals.

**(b)** Is this trait autosomal or sex-linked? Give reason in support of your answer.

**Answer:** The trait is **autosomal**, because it affects both males and females (affected individuals appear in both sexes across generations), ruling out sex-linked (X-linked) inheritance.

**(c)** Write the possible genotypes of the children numbers '1' and '3' of the second generation.

**Answer:**

- **Child 1 (Gen II):** Since child 1 is unaffected but is married to an affected female (aa), child 1 must carry at least one dominant allele. Given Gen I parents are both carriers (Aa × Aa), child 1's genotype is **Aa** (carrier).
- **Child 3 (Gen II):** Child 3 is affected (filled symbol), therefore genotype is **aa**.

---

### Q24.

**(a)** Write the characteristics of 'stem cells'.

**Answer:** Stem cells possess the following key characteristics:

1. **Self-renewal:** They can divide and replicate themselves indefinitely.
2. **Pluripotency/Multipotency:** They have the ability to differentiate into various specialised cell types.
3. **Undifferentiated state:** They remain undifferentiated until stimulated by specific signals.

**(b)** From where can one obtain 'stem cells' in humans?

**Answer:** Stem cells in humans can be obtained from:

1. **Embryos** — Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the inner cell mass of blastocysts
2. **Bone marrow** — Haematopoietic stem cells
3. **Umbilical cord blood** — Cord blood stem cells
4. **Adult tissues** — Adult stem cells from various organs

**(c)** State any two applications of 'stem cells' in curing human diseases.

**Answer:**

1. **Treating leukaemia and blood disorders** through bone marrow transplants, where stem cells repopulate and restore the haematopoietic system.
2. **Repairing damaged tissues or organs** — e.g., regenerating cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction (heart attack), or treating spinal cord injuries by replacing damaged neural cells.

### Q25.

**(a)** Differentiate between malignant and benign tumours.

**Answer:**

| Feature | Malignant Tumour | Benign Tumour |
|---|---|---|
| Nature | Cancerous | Non-cancerous |
| Growth | Rapid and uncontrolled | Slow and localised |
| Invasion | Invades surrounding tissues | Does not invade nearby tissues |
| Metastasis | Can spread to distant organs (metastasise) | Does not spread |
| Threat to life | Potentially fatal | Generally not life-threatening |

**(b)** Name and explain the most feared property of a malignant tumour.

**Answer:** The most feared property is **Metastasis**.

**Explanation:** Metastasis is the ability of malignant cancer cells to detach from the primary tumour site, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system, travel to distant organs or tissues, and establish new tumour colonies (secondary tumours) at those sites. This property makes cancer extremely difficult to treat, as the disease spreads throughout the body and may be present in multiple organs simultaneously.

---

### Q26.
Treatment of wastewater is done in a sewage treatment plant to make it less polluting. Explain the following with reference to this treatment process:

**(a)** Primary sludge:

**Answer:** Primary sludge refers to the **solid matter (suspended solids and settleable particles)** that settles at the bottom of the primary settling tank during primary (physical) treatment of wastewater. This sedimentation removes floating debris, grit, and large solid particles. The settled solid material is called primary sludge.

**(b)** Activated sludge:

**Answer:** Activated sludge is the **biologically active mass** produced during secondary (biological) treatment. In the aeration tank, the effluent from primary treatment is aerated and mixed with a **microbial inoculum** containing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. These microorganisms form flocs that digest dissolved organic matter. The resulting active microbial biomass (floc) is called activated sludge. A portion is recycled back into the aeration tank as inoculum; the rest is pumped to sludge digesters.

**(c)** Anaerobic sludge digesters:

**Answer:** Anaerobic sludge digesters are **enclosed chambers** where the primary and secondary sludge is subjected to anaerobic decomposition by anaerobic bacteria. During this process, the bacteria break down the organic matter in the sludge in the absence of oxygen, producing **biogas** — a mixture of methane (CH₄), CO₂, and H₂S. This biogas can be used as a source of energy. The digested sludge can be used as manure.

### Q27.

**(a)** Name the two primate ancestors of the present-day humans, who existed approximately about 15 million years ago.

**Answer:** **Dryopithecus** and **Ramapithecus**

**(b)** According to geological records, when and where did Australopithecines live?

**Answer:** Australopithecines lived in **Africa** approximately **4 million to 2 million years ago**. They were among the earliest hominids and were capable of bipedal locomotion.

**(c)** Give two differences between *Homo habilis* and *Homo erectus*.

**Answer:**

| Feature | *Homo habilis* | *Homo erectus* |
|---|---|---|
| **Brain capacity** | Smaller (650–800 cc) | Larger (900–1100 cc) |
| **Tool use** | Used primitive stone tools (Oldowan tools); probably did not eat meat | Used more advanced tools; evidence of use of fire for cooking |
| **Time period** | ~2 million years ago | ~1.5 million years ago |
| **Posture** | Less erect | More fully erect bipedal |

### Q28 (a).

**(i)** Expand the abbreviations given below, used for different modes of assisted reproductive technologies:

**(1) ZIFT:**
**Answer:** **Z**ygote **I**ntra**f**allopian **T**ransfer

**(2) ICSI:**
**Answer:** **I**ntra**c**ytoplasmic **S**perm **I**njection

**(3) IUT:**
**Answer:** **I**ntra**u**terine **T**ransfer

**(4) GIFT:**
**Answer:** **G**amete **I**ntra**f**allopian **T**ransfer

**(ii)** Which one of them cannot be considered as a procedure of IVF? Give reasons in support of your answer.

**Answer:** **GIFT (Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer)** cannot be considered a procedure of IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation).

**Reason:** In GIFT, the gametes (sperm and eggs) are directly transferred into the fallopian tubes, where fertilisation occurs **naturally inside the body (in vivo)**. IVF, by definition, requires fertilisation to occur **outside the body in a laboratory (in vitro)**. Since GIFT does not involve the in vitro fertilisation step, it cannot be classified as an IVF procedure.

### Q28 (b).
Differentiate between the following:

**(i) Perisperm and Pericarp:**

**Answer:**

| Feature | Perisperm | Pericarp |
|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | Remnant of nutritive tissue derived from the nucellus | Wall of the ovary that develops into the fruit wall |
| **Origin** | Derived from nucellus (part of ovule) | Derived from the ovary wall |
| **Presence** | Found in some seeds (e.g., black pepper, beet) | Found in all fruits |
| **Function** | Provides nourishment to the developing embryo | Protects seeds and aids in dispersal |
| **Nature** | Seed tissue | Fruit tissue |

**(ii) Syncarpous pistil and Apocarpous pistil:**

**Answer:**

**(iii) Plumule and Radicle:**

**Answer:**

| Feature | Plumule | Radicle |
|---|---|---|
| **Definition** | Embryonic shoot (future shoot system) | Embryonic root (future root system) |
| **Development** | Develops into the shoot system bearing leaves and branches | Develops into the primary root system |
| **Position in embryo** | Located above the cotyledons (epicotyl region) | Located below the cotyledons (hypocotyl region) |
| **First emergence** | Emerges after radicle during germination; gives rise to first true leaves | First to emerge during seed germination; anchors the seedling |

### Q29.

*Read the following passage and answer the questions:*

Gene expresses itself in a cell system as a protein/enzyme. How does an expression of gene occur in a cell system and when does it need to occur, and how the gene expression is regulated in a prokaryote cell system was studied by the combined efforts of Jacque Monod, the biochemist and Francois Jacob, the geneticist. For their work on lactose metabolism in *E. coli* and introducing the concept of 'lac operon' they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965.

**(a)** Why is lac operon said to be a transcriptionally regulated system? *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** The lac operon is said to be a transcriptionally regulated system because **the regulation occurs at the level of transcription** — the binding or removal of the repressor protein from the operator region directly controls whether RNA polymerase can transcribe the structural genes (lacZ, lacY, lacA). The presence or absence of the inducer (allolactose) determines whether transcription is switched ON or OFF.

---

**(b)** It is said that "the lac operon has to be operational at a very low level in the bacterial cell all the time." Justify. *(½ mark)*

**Answer:** The lac operon must remain operational at a very low (basal) level at all times to ensure that a **small number of β-galactosidase molecules** are always present in the cell. When lactose becomes available in the environment, these few β-galactosidase molecules convert lactose into **allolactose** (the true inducer), which then binds to the repressor, inactivates it, and allows full induction of the operon.

---

**(c)** Why is the regulator gene in lac operon marked as the 'i' gene? *(½ mark)*

**Answer:** The regulator gene is marked as the **'i' gene** because 'i' stands for **inhibitor** — the gene codes for the **repressor protein** (inhibitor), which binds to the operator region and prevents (inhibits) transcription of the structural genes in the absence of the inducer.

---

**(d)** Draw a schematic diagram of lac operon in **absence of inducer** in the culture medium of the bacteria. *(2 marks)*

**Answer:**

[Diagram: The lac operon in the absence of inducer (repressed state):
- Regulator gene (i) → produces active Repressor protein
- The active Repressor binds to the Operator (O) region
- Structure from left to right: Regulator gene (i) | Promoter (P) | Operator (O) [with Repressor bound] | lacZ | lacY | lacA
- RNA Polymerase is blocked from proceeding past the Operator
- Result: NO transcription of lacZ, lacY, lacA structural genes
- Labels: CAP site, Promoter, Operator (with bound Repressor shown as a block), Structural genes lacZ, lacY, lacA]

$$\underbrace{i}_{\text{Regulator}} \quad \underbrace{P}_{\text{Promoter}} \quad \underbrace{O}_{\text{Operator}} \quad \underbrace{z \quad y \quad a}_{\text{Structural genes}}$$

- Active repressor (encoded by **i** gene) binds to **Operator**
- RNA polymerase is **blocked** → **No transcription**
- No β-galactosidase, permease, or transacetylase produced

---

**OR**

---

**(d)** Draw a schematic diagram of lac operon in the **presence of inducer** in the culture medium of the bacteria. *(2 marks)*

**Answer:**

[Diagram: The lac operon in the presence of inducer (induced state):
- Regulator gene (i) → produces Repressor protein
- Inducer (allolactose) binds to the Repressor → forms Inducer-Repressor complex (Inactive Repressor)
- The inactive repressor CANNOT bind to the Operator
- Operator is free → RNA Polymerase proceeds along the structural genes
- Structure from left to right: i | P | O (free) | lacZ | lacY | lacA
- Transcription occurs → mRNA is produced → β-galactosidase, Permease, Transacetylase are synthesised]

$$\underbrace{i}_{\text{Regulator}} \quad \underbrace{P}_{\text{Promoter}} \quad \underbrace{O}_{\text{Operator (free)}} \quad \underbrace{z \quad y \quad a}_{\text{Structural genes}} \xrightarrow{\text{Transcription}} \text{mRNA}$$

- Inducer (allolactose) binds to Repressor → **Inactive Repressor-Inducer complex**
- Operator is **free** → RNA Polymerase transcribes structural genes
- Products: **β-galactosidase** (lacZ), **Permease** (lacY), **Transacetylase** (lacA)

### Q30.

Study the diagrammatic representation given below of the Earth with regions marked 'A' and 'B' respectively.

[Diagram: A circle representing the Earth with latitude lines marked at 90°N, 60°N, 30°N, Equator 0°, 30°S, 60°S, and 90°S. Region 'A' is indicated on the right side near the Equator (tropical region, ~0° to 30°S). Region 'B' is indicated on the right side at a higher latitude (~60°S to 90°S, polar/temperate region).]

**(a)** Write the observations made regarding the species diversity when moving from region 'A' to region 'B'. Give two reasons also. *(3 marks)*

**Answer:**

**Observation:** Species diversity **decreases** when moving from region 'A' (near the equator / tropics) to region 'B' (higher latitudes / polar regions). This pattern is known as the **latitudinal gradient in species diversity**.

**Reasons:**

1. **Higher solar energy availability** near the equator leads to greater primary productivity, which supports more complex and diverse food webs, enabling a larger number of species to coexist.
2. **Greater climate stability** in tropical regions over long evolutionary time periods has allowed more species to evolve and specialise into distinct ecological niches, reducing extinction rates and increasing speciation rates compared to the variable climates at higher latitudes.

---

**(b)** Stating the reason, mention the approximate number of bird species recorded in India. *(1 mark)*

**Answer:** India has approximately **1,300 bird species** recorded. This high avian diversity is attributed to India's wide range of habitats — forests, grasslands, wetlands, coastal areas, deserts, and mountains — as well as its strategic geographical location along major **migratory flyways**, which supports both resident and migratory bird populations throughout the year.

---

**OR**

---

**(c)** Name the region in the world that records the greatest biodiversity and mention why.

**Answer:** The **Amazon Rainforest** (Amazon Basin) in South America records the **greatest biodiversity** in the world.

**Reasons:**
- It covers an enormous geographic area with **immense habitat heterogeneity**
- Stable, **warm and humid tropical climate** throughout the year
- Long evolutionary history with minimal climatic disruptions, allowing speciation over millions of years
- High primary productivity supports complex multi-layered food webs
- Contains approximately **10% of all species on Earth**, including millions of insects, thousands of plant species, and hundreds of bird and mammal species

### Q31 (a).
Meselson and Stahl carried out an experiment to prove the nature of DNA replication. Recall the experiment and answer the following questions.

**(i)** Which two types of nitrogen were used by them in their experiment and why?

**Answer:** They used:
- **$^{15}$N (heavy nitrogen)** — a heavy isotope of nitrogen
- **$^{14}$N (light/normal nitrogen)** — the common lighter isotope of nitrogen

**Why:** These two isotopes were used because they have **different atomic masses**, causing DNA molecules that contain them to have different densities. This density difference could be detected and separated using **CsCl (caesium chloride) density gradient centrifugation**, allowing researchers to distinguish between parental (old) DNA strands (labelled with $^{15}$N) and newly synthesised strands (labelled with $^{14}$N).

---

**(ii)** Why did they take samples of *E. coli* at definite time intervals for their observation?

**Answer:** Samples were taken at definite time intervals (corresponding to **one generation, two generations**, etc.) to observe how the density of DNA molecules changed with each successive round of replication. By comparing the density bands at each generation:
- **Generation 0** (only $^{15}$N–$^{15}$N DNA): one heavy band
- **Generation 1** (after transfer to $^{14}$N medium): one hybrid ($^{15}$N–$^{14}$N) band at intermediate density
- **Generation 2**: one hybrid band + one light ($^{14}$N–$^{14}$N) band

This progressive pattern allowed them to identify the **semi-conservative** nature of DNA replication.

---

**(iii)** State the role of caesium chloride density gradient in their experiment.

**Answer:** The **CsCl density gradient centrifugation** was used to **separate DNA molecules based on their buoyant density**. When DNA samples from *E. coli* grown in different nitrogen media were centrifuged in CsCl solution at high speed, DNA molecules migrated to positions corresponding to their density:
- $^{15}$N–$^{15}$N DNA (heavy) — settled lower (higher density band)
- $^{14}$N–$^{14}$N DNA (light) — settled higher (lower density band)
- $^{15}$N–$^{14}$N DNA (hybrid) — settled at an **intermediate position**

This allowed precise physical separation and identification of parental and newly synthesised DNA strands.

---

**(iv)** Write the conclusions they arrived at. *(5 marks total for Q31a)*

**Answer:** Meselson and Stahl concluded that:

1. **DNA replication is semi-conservative** — during replication, the two strands of the parental DNA molecule separate, and each serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.
2. Each resulting daughter DNA molecule consists of **one old (parental) strand and one newly synthesised (daughter) strand**.
3. This was confirmed by the appearance of **only hybrid ($^{15}$N–$^{14}$N) density DNA** after the first generation (ruling out conservative replication, which would produce one all-heavy and one all-light band), and **both hybrid and light DNA** after the second generation (ruling out dispersive replication).

---

**OR**

### Q31 (b).

**(i)** A true-breeding tall pea plant with round seeds is crossed with a recessive dwarf pea plant having wrinkled seeds. Work out the cross up to F₂ generation giving the phenotypic ratios of F₁ and F₂ generation respectively.

**Answer:**

**Parental cross:**

| | Parent 1 (True-breeding tall, round) | Parent 2 (Dwarf, wrinkled) |
|---|---|---|
| **Phenotype** | Tall, Round | Dwarf, Wrinkled |
| **Genotype** | TTRR | ttrr |
| **Gametes** | TR | tr |

**F₁ Generation:**

$$TTRR \times ttrr \rightarrow \text{All } TtRr$$

**F₁ Phenotype:** All plants are **Tall with Round seeds** (TtRr)
**F₁ Phenotypic ratio:** 1 (all Tall Round) — uniform

---

**F₂ Generation** (F₁ × F₁: TtRr × TtRr):

**Gametes produced by F₁:** TR, Tr, tR, tr (each in equal proportion)

| | **TR** | **Tr** | **tR** | **tr** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TR** | TTRR | TTRr | TtRR | TtRr |
| **Tr** | TTRr | TTrr | TtRr | Ttrr |
| **tR** | TtRR | TtRr | ttRR | ttRr |
| **tr** | TtRr | Ttrr | ttRr | ttrr |

**F₂ Phenotypic classes:**

| Phenotype | Genotypes | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Tall Round (T\_R\_) | TTRR, TTRr, TtRR, TtRr | 9 |
| Tall Wrinkled (T\_rr) | TTrr, Ttrr | 3 |
| Dwarf Round (ttR\_) | ttRR, ttRr | 3 |
| Dwarf Wrinkled (ttrr) | ttrr | 1 |

**F₂ Phenotypic ratio = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1**

(9 Tall Round : 3 Tall Wrinkled : 3 Dwarf Round : 1 Dwarf Wrinkled)

---

**(ii)** State the Mendelian principle that can be derived only with the help of such a cross.

**Answer:** The **Law of Independent Assortment** (Mendel's Second Law) can be derived only with the help of a **dihybrid cross** such as this.

**Statement:** "When two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, the segregation of one pair of characters is **independent** of the other pair of characters during gamete formation."

This is evidenced by the F₂ ratio of 9:3:3:1, which shows that the gene for plant height (T/t) and the gene for seed texture (R/r) segregate independently, producing all possible combinations of the two traits in their expected Mendelian proportions.

### Q32 (a).
A time-bound vaccination program is followed for the children in our country from their birth up to ten years of age. A graph plotted below shows the effect of the vaccination followed by infection by the same pathogen, and the antibody concentration in the blood of the child.

[Diagram: A graph with "Antibody concentration in Blood" on the Y-axis and "Days after administration of vaccine" on the X-axis (0 to 500 days). Two curves are shown: a solid line and a dashed line. The vaccine is administered at day 0. The antibody level rises slowly (primary immune response — solid line, small peak around day 50–100) then declines. At approximately day 150, reinfection with the same pathogen occurs, and the dashed line shows a much sharper, higher, and faster rise in antibody concentration (secondary immune response), reaching a plateau and declining slowly.]

**(i)** Explain why the administration of a vaccine causes an increase in the antibody concentration.

**Answer:** When a vaccine is administered, it introduces **antigens** (weakened, killed, or attenuated pathogens, or their surface proteins) into the body. The immune system recognises these antigens as foreign and mounts a **primary immune response**:
- **B-lymphocytes** are activated and differentiate into plasma cells
- Plasma cells secrete **specific antibodies** against the antigen
- Some B-cells and T-cells become **memory cells**

This results in an initial increase in antibody concentration in the blood.

---

**(ii)** If the child is infected with the same pathogen almost four months later, the antibody concentration in his/her blood increases very fast. Explain why.

**Answer:** Upon reinfection with the same pathogen, the **memory B-cells and memory T-cells** (formed during the primary immune response triggered by vaccination) rapidly recognise the pathogen's antigens. These memory cells:
- Are **long-lived and present in large numbers**
- Can be **quickly activated** without the delay of the primary response
- Rapidly proliferate and differentiate into effector cells

This produces a **secondary (anamnestic) immune response** — characterised by a **faster, stronger, and more prolonged** increase in antibody concentration, effectively neutralising the pathogen before it causes disease.

---

**(iii)** A table given below gives information about different types of immunity and how they are attained. Identify 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S' and 'T' in the table.

| | Type of immunity | Production of antibodies | Presence of memory cells | Mode attained |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (1) | Natural, active | Yes | **'P'** | **'Q'** |
| (2) | Natural, passive | No | **'R'** | Across the placenta during pregnancy / breast feeding |
| (3) | Acquired, active | **'S'** | Yes | Getting a vaccine |
| (4) | Acquired, passive | **'T'** | No | Getting an injection of antibodies |

**Answer:**

- **P:** Yes (memory cells ARE present in natural active immunity)
- **Q:** Getting an infection / natural exposure to the pathogen (e.g., recovering from a disease)
- **R:** No (memory cells are NOT present in natural passive immunity — antibodies are transferred ready-made, not produced by the recipient's immune system)
- **S:** Yes (antibodies ARE produced in acquired active immunity following vaccination)
- **T:** No (antibodies are NOT produced by the recipient in acquired passive immunity — pre-formed antibodies are directly injected)

---

**OR**

### Q32 (b).

**(i)** What is the chemical name of 'smack'? Why is the consumption of smack considered as an abuse? *(5 marks total)*

**Answer:**

- **Chemical name of 'smack':** **Diacetylmorphine** (also known as **heroin**)
- It is a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound derived from morphine (obtained from *Papaver somniferum*)

**Why considered abuse:**
1. It is a **central nervous system depressant** that causes sedation, euphoria, and pain relief but also leads to **severe respiratory depression** and can cause death by overdose.
2. It is **highly addictive** — users develop strong physical and psychological dependence.
3. Consumption leads to **tolerance** (requiring increasing doses for the same effect).
4. Withdrawal symptoms are extremely severe.
5. It is a **Schedule I controlled substance** with no accepted medical use in current practice, making its non-medical use illegal and an abuse.

---

**(ii)** Name the source plant and one effect of the following drugs on the human body:

**(1) Marijuana:**

**Answer:**
- **Source plant:** *Cannabis sativa* (Hemp plant) — extracted from the leaves and flowers
- **Effect on body:** Acts as a **hallucinogen and CNS depressant**; causes euphoria, altered perception of time and space, increased appetite, impaired short-term memory, and at high doses, hallucinations and paranoia.

---

**(2) Cocaine:**

**Answer:**
- **Source plant:** *Erythroxylum coca* (Coca plant)
- **Effect on body:** Acts as a **CNS stimulant**; causes intense euphoria, increased heart rate and blood pressure, elevated energy and alertness, decreased appetite. Chronic use leads to cardiovascular damage, paranoia, and severe addiction.

---

**(3) Morphine:**

**Answer:**
- **Source plant:** *Papaver somniferum* (Opium poppy) — extracted from the latex of unripe seed capsules
- **Effect on body:** Acts as a **potent analgesic (pain reliever) and CNS depressant**; causes pain relief, sedation, euphoria, slowed breathing, constipation. Medically used for severe pain management, but highly addictive with potential for abuse and fatal overdose.

### Q33 (a).
Study the diagram given below showing the modes of pollination. Answer the questions that follow:

[Diagram: Two plants are shown. The plant on the right is isolated (Plant 1). The plant on the left has two flowers labelled 2 and 3. An arrow labelled '3' shows pollen being transferred from the right plant (Plant 1) to the left plant. An arrow from one flower to another on the same plant (left plant) represents method '2'. An arrow within the same flower (self-pollination) is represented by method '1'... Based on standard biology diagrams: Method 1 = pollen to stigma of same flower (Autogamy); Method 2 = pollen to a different flower of the same plant (Geitonogamy); Method 3 = pollen to a flower of a different plant (Xenogamy).]

**(i)** The given diagram shows three methods of pollen transfer in plants. What are the technical terms used for pollen transfer methods '1', '2' and '3'?

**Answer:**

- **1: Autogamy** — transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the **same flower**
- **2: Geitonogamy** — transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the **same plant**
- **3: Xenogamy** — transfer of pollen from the anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a flower on a **genetically different plant** (cross-pollination)

---

**(ii)** How do the following plants achieve pollination successfully?

**(1) Water lily:**

**Answer:** Water lily achieves pollination by **hydrophily** (water pollination). In water lilies, pollen grains are released on the water surface and float towards the stigma of other flowers. The pollen grains may also be carried by water currents. In some species, the flower remains at the water surface, facilitating surface hydrophily.

**(2) *Vallisneria*:**

**Answer:** *Vallisneria* achieves pollination by **hydrophily** (specifically, **ephydrophily** — pollination at the water surface). The male flowers are small and released at the water surface, where they float towards the larger female flowers that are held at the surface by long peduncles. Upon contact, pollination occurs.

---

**(iii)** Flowering plants have developed many devices to avoid inbreeding depression. Explain one hereditary and one physiological device which helps plants to achieve this target. *(5 marks total)*

**Answer:**

**Hereditary (Genetic) Device — Self-incompatibility:**
Self-incompatibility (SI) is a **genetically controlled mechanism** that prevents self-fertilisation. It is governed by a **multi-allelic S-locus**. When the pollen grain carries the same S-allele as the pistil, a recognition reaction occurs — the pollen tube growth is inhibited either in the stigma or in the style, preventing fertilisation. This ensures that only pollen from a genetically different individual (carrying a different S-allele) can successfully fertilise the ovules, thus promoting **outbreeding (xenogamy)** and preventing inbreeding depression.

**Physiological Device — Dichogamy:**
Dichogamy is the condition in which the **anthers and stigma of the same flower mature at different times**, preventing self-pollination:
- **Protandry:** Anthers mature and release pollen before the stigma of the same flower becomes receptive (e.g., sunflower, marigold).
- **Protogyny:** Stigma becomes receptive before the anthers of the same flower mature (e.g., *Mirabilis*).

By ensuring that the pollen and stigma of the same flower are not simultaneously functional, dichogamy promotes cross-pollination and helps avoid inbreeding depression.

### Q33 (b).
Observe the diagram given below showing the menstrual cycle of a normal human female and answer the questions that follow:

[Diagram: A circular diagram divided into 28 segments, each numbered 1–28, representing the days of the menstrual cycle. The numbers are arranged around the circle, with day 1 at the top and proceeding clockwise. Brackets on the outer edge of the circle demarcate four distinct phases corresponding to specific day ranges.]

**(i)** What are the suitable technical terms used for the following?

**(1) Days 1 – 7:**
**Answer:** **Menstrual Phase** — characterised by the breakdown and shedding of the endometrial lining (menstrual flow) due to the fall in progesterone and estrogen levels if fertilisation has not occurred.

**(2) Days 8 – 12:**
**Answer:** **Follicular Phase** (also called the Proliferative Phase) — characterised by growth and maturation of the Graafian follicle in the ovary under the influence of FSH, and regeneration/thickening of the endometrial lining under the influence of estrogen.

**(3) Days 16 – 28:**
**Answer:** **Luteal Phase** (also called the Secretory Phase) — characterised by the formation of the corpus luteum from the ruptured follicle (after ovulation), which secretes progesterone and some estrogen to maintain the thickened endometrium in preparation for possible implantation.

**(4) Days 13 – 15:**
**Answer:** **Ovulatory Phase** — characterised by the **LH surge** (peak of luteinising hormone) from the anterior pituitary, which triggers **ovulation** (release of the secondary oocyte from the mature Graafian follicle) around day 14.

---

**(ii)** Explain the role of ovarian and pituitary hormones during the following time periods:

**(1) Days 8 – 12 (Follicular Phase):**

**Answer:**
- **Pituitary hormone — FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone):** Stimulates the growth and maturation of the primary follicle into a Graafian follicle in the ovary. FSH levels gradually rise during this phase.
- **Ovarian hormone — Estrogen:** Secreted by the growing follicle (granulosa cells) under FSH stimulation. Estrogen causes the **proliferation and thickening of the endometrial lining** (uterine wall) in preparation for potential implantation. Rising estrogen also exerts positive feedback on the pituitary, contributing to the LH surge.

---

**(2) Days 13 – 15 (Ovulatory Phase):**

**Answer:**
- **Pituitary hormone — LH (Luteinising Hormone):** A dramatic **LH surge** (sharp peak) occurs around day 13–14, triggered by the positive feedback of high estrogen levels. This LH surge is the direct trigger for **ovulation** — the rupture of the mature Graafian follicle and release of the secondary oocyte (egg) from the ovary into the fallopian tube.
- **Pituitary hormone — FSH:** Also peaks slightly around ovulation, aiding in follicle maturation.
- **Ovarian hormone — Estrogen:** Peaks just before the LH surge, providing the positive feedback signal.

---

**(3) Days 16 – 28 (Luteal Phase):**

**Answer:**
- **Ovarian hormone — Progesterone:** After ovulation, the ruptured Graafian follicle transforms into the **corpus luteum** (yellow body) under the influence of LH. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of **progesterone** (and some estrogen), which:
  - Maintains the thickened, vascular endometrial lining in a **secretory state**, ready for implantation of a fertilised egg
  - Suppresses further FSH and LH secretion (negative feedback), preventing new follicle development
- **If fertilisation does not occur:** The corpus luteum degenerates (~day 26–28) → progesterone and estrogen levels fall → endometrium breaks down → menstruation begins (Day 1 of next cycle).
- **If fertilisation occurs:** The developing embryo secretes **hCG (human Chorionic Gonadotropin)**, which maintains the corpus luteum, sustaining progesterone production throughout early pregnancy.
