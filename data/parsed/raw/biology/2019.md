### Q1.
British geneticist R.C. Punnett developed a graphical representation of a genetic cross called **"Punnett Square"**. Mention the possible result this representation predicts of the genetic cross carried.

**Answer:**
The Punnett Square predicts that the phenotypic ratio in the $F_2$ generation of a Mendelian monohybrid cross is **3:1**.

**Solution:**
Punnett Square for a Mendelian monohybrid cross between pure line tall (TT) and dwarf (tt) plants:

**Parent Generation:**
$$TT \times tt$$

**$F_1$ Generation:**
$$\downarrow$$
$$Tt$$

**$F_1 \times F_1$ (Selfing):**
$$Tt \times Tt$$

**$F_2$ Generation Punnett Square:**

|   | **T** | **t** |
|---|-------|-------|
| **T** | TT | Tt |
| **t** | Tt | tt |

- **Phenotypic ratio** in $F_2$: **3 Tall : 1 Dwarf** (i.e., 3:1)
- **Genotypic ratio** in $F_2$: **1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt**

### Q6.
You are conducting artificial hybridization on **papaya** and **potato**. Which one of them would require the step of emasculation and why? However, for both you will use the process of bagging. Justify giving one reason.

**Answer & Solution:**

- **Emasculation** is required in **potato** because potato bears **bisexual flowers**. Removal of stamens (emasculation) is necessary to prevent self-pollination before artificial hybridization.
- Emasculation is **not** required in **papaya** because papaya bears **unisexual flowers** (either male or female flowers on separate plants), so self-pollination is not possible.

**Bagging** is performed in **both** papaya and potato because the stigma needs to be **protected from contamination by undesired pollen** from external sources, ensuring controlled pollination.

---

### Q7.
How would **gene flow** or **genetic drift** affect the population in which either of them happens to take place?

**Answer & Solution:**

1. **Gene flow** (gene migration, occurring multiple times) or **genetic drift** (a sudden, chance event) affects the population by **changing allele frequencies** in both old and new populations, thereby **altering the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium**.

2. Effects:
   - **(a)** Disturbance in genetic equilibrium would be interpreted as resulting in **evolution** in a population.
   - **(b)** If the original drifted population becomes founders of a new population, the effect is called the **Founder Effect**.

### Q8.
Differentiate between the roles of **B-lymphocytes** and **T-lymphocytes** in generating immune responses.

**Answer & Solution:**

| Feature | **T-Lymphocytes** | **B-Lymphocytes** |
|---|---|---|
| **Origin & Maturation** | Originate in bone marrow; mature in the **thymus** | Born and also mature in **bone marrow** |
| **Differentiation** | Differentiate into helper, regulatory, or cytotoxic T cells, or become memory T cells | Differentiate into **plasma cells**, which secrete immunoglobulins (antibodies) |
| **Type of Immunity** | Involved in **cell-mediated immunity** | Primarily responsible for **humoral immunity** (antibody-mediated) |

**OR**

**Principle of vaccination is based on the property of "memory" of the immune system. Taking one suitable example, justify the statement.**

**Answer & Solution:**

- In vaccination, a preparation of **antigenic proteins** of the pathogen or an **attenuated (inactivated/weakened) pathogen** is introduced into the body.
- The antibodies produced in the body against these antigens will **neutralize the pathogenic agents** during actual infection.
- The vaccine also generates **memory B-cells and T-cells** that recognize the pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and mount a faster, stronger immune response.
- **Example:** Vaccination against **polio** prevents the actual poliovirus from causing infection, because the immune system has memory of the antigen from the vaccine.

### Q9.
Explain the relevance of **"Totipotency"** and **"Somaclones"** in raising healthy banana plants from virus-infected banana plants.

**Answer & Solution:**

- **Totipotency** is defined as the ability of a single cell/explant to give rise to a whole new plant. This property allows the **meristematic tissue** of a banana plant to be grown in a culture medium.
- As meristematic cells are **not infected (virus-free)** and being totipotent, they can form the **callus**.
- The plants produced via tissue culture are called **Somaclones** because of their genetic and morphological similarity to the parent plant.
- These somaclones then give rise to new plantlets that are **infection-free (healthy)**.

---

### Q10.
How is a **continuous culture system** maintained in bioreactors, and why?

**Answer & Solution:**

- In a continuous culture system, the **used medium is drained out from one side** while **fresh medium is added from the other side**.
- This is done to **maintain cells in their physiologically most active log/exponential phase**.
- The continuous culture method produces a **larger biomass**, leading to a **higher yield of the desired protein/product**.

### Q11.
List any **four ways** by which GMOs have been useful for enhanced crop output.

**Answer & Solution:**

GMOs have been useful for enhanced crop output in the following ways:

1. Genetically modified crops are more **tolerant to abiotic stresses** (cold, drought, salt, heat), leading to better survival and yield.
2. Genetic modifications have helped **reduce post-harvest losses**, implying less damage to crop yield.
3. Genetic modification has **reduced reliance on chemical pesticides** by creating pest-resistant crops (e.g., Tobacco), leading to greater crop yield.
4. Creation of **insect-resistant crops** such as **Bt cotton** and **Bt corn** has enhanced crop yield.
5. **Increased efficiency of mineral usage** by GM plants prevents early exhaustion of soil fertility, resulting in increased yield.

*(Any four of the above points are acceptable.)*

### Q12.
Mention **four significant services** that a healthy forest ecosystem provides.

**Answer & Solution:**

Ecosystem services provided by healthy forest ecosystems:

1. **Purification of air**
2. **Maintenance of biodiversity**
3. **Provide wildlife habitat**
4. **Storage site for carbon** (carbon sequestration)
5. **Cycling of nutrients**
6. **Mitigate droughts and floods**

*(Any four of the above points are acceptable.)*

**OR**

**Substantiate with the help of one example that in an ecosystem, mutualists:**
**(i) tend to co-evolve, and**
**(ii) are also one of the major causes of biodiversity loss.**

**Answer & Solution:**

**(i) Co-evolution in Mutualists:**
In nature, mutualists often **co-evolve**. For example, in the Mediterranean orchid ***Ophrys***, the plant employs **sexual deceit** to get pollinated by a species of bee. One petal of the flower **resembles a female bee**. If the female bee changes its colour pattern even slightly, the success of pollination will be reduced — **unless the orchid flower co-evolves** to maintain its resemblance to the female bee. This demonstrates co-evolution between the orchid and the bee.

**(ii) Mutualists and Biodiversity Loss:**
**Co-extinction** is one of the **'Evil Quartet'** causes of biodiversity loss. In obligatory mutualistic relationships (such as plant–pollinator mutualism), the extinction of one partner will inevitably lead to the **extinction of the other partner** as well. For example, if a specific pollinator species is eliminated, the plant dependent on it for pollination may also go extinct.

### Q13.
**Pollen banks** are playing a very important role in promoting plant breeding programmes the world over. How are pollens preserved in the pollen banks? Explain. How are such banks benefitting our farmers? Write any **two ways**.

**Answer & Solution:**

**Preservation in Pollen Banks:**
- Pollens are preserved using **cryopreservation**, i.e., they are stored in a viable condition at **very low temperatures (−196°C)** using **liquid nitrogen**.
- This allows pollens to be stored for a very long period of time while remaining viable and fertile.

**Benefits to Farmers:**

1. **Preservation of agricultural biodiversity** in the form of valuable genetic resources — rare and useful germplasm can be stored for future use.
2. These pollens can be used in various **crop hybridization breeding programmes**, as well as in biochemical and physiochemical studies, such as the study of allergens, enabling development of better crop varieties.

### Q14.
Draw a labelled diagram to show the interrelationship of four accessory ducts in a human male reproductive system.

**Answer & Solution:**

[Diagram: A labelled diagram of the human male reproductive system showing the four accessory ducts in interrelationship:
- **Rete testis** — a network of channels within the testis that collect sperm
- **Vasa efferentia** — ducts leading from the rete testis to the epididymis
- **Epididymis** — a coiled duct where sperm mature and are stored
- **Vas deferens** — the duct that carries sperm from the epididymis upward toward the urethra
The diagram shows the sequence: Seminiferous tubules → Rete testis → Vasa efferentia → Epididymis → Vas deferens]

**OR**

### Q15.
Compare in any **three ways** the chromosomal theory of inheritance as proposed by Sutton and Boveri with that of experimental results on pea plant presented by Mendel.

**Answer & Solution:**

Through the following ways, the chromosomal theory of inheritance and Mendel's experimental results can be compared:

| Mendel's Observations | Sutton & Boveri's Chromosomal Theory |
|---|---|
| **(i)** Factors (genes) occur in **pairs** in a diploid organism | Chromosomes also occur in **pairs** in a diploid organism |
| **(ii)** Factors **segregate** at the time of gamete formation, so that only one of each pair is transmitted to a gamete | Chromosomes also **segregate** at the time of gamete formation (during meiosis), with only one of each pair going to a gamete |
| **(iii)** A gamete contains only **one of the two alleles** of a trait | A gamete contains only **one chromosome** of each homologous pair |
| **(iv)** The paired condition of Mendelian factors is **restored during fertilisation** | The paired condition of chromosomes is also **restored during fertilisation** |

*(Any three of the above comparisons are acceptable.)*

**OR**

**(a) Explain linkage and recombination as put forth by T.H. Morgan based on his observations with *Drosophila melanogaster* crossing experiment.**

**(b) Write the basis on which Alfred Sturtevant explained gene mapping.**

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Linkage and Recombination (T.H. Morgan):**

- T.H. Morgan studied **X-linked genes** in *Drosophila melanogaster*.
- He observed that when **two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome**, the proportion of **parental gene combinations was much higher** than the non-parental (recombinant) type.
- He attributed this to the **physical association (linkage)** of the two genes on the same chromosome and coined the term **"Linkage"**.
- The term **"Recombination"** describes the generation of **non-parental gene combinations**, which occur due to crossing over between linked genes during meiosis.
- Genes that are **tightly linked** show very low recombination frequency, whereas **loosely linked** genes show higher recombination frequency.

**(b) Alfred Sturtevant — Gene Mapping:**

- Alfred Sturtevant used the **frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome** as a **measure of the distance between genes**.
- He mapped their positions on the chromosome — genes with **higher recombination frequency** are **farther apart**, and genes with **lower recombination frequency** are **closer together**.
- He thus created the first **genetic/chromosome map** (linkage map).

### Q16.
Explain the mechanism of **DNA replication** with the help of a replication fork. What role does the enzyme **DNA-ligase** play in a DNA replication fork?

**Answer & Solution:**

**Mechanism of DNA Replication:**

- DNA replication occurs at small **replication forks**. It does not occur along the entire length of the DNA at once; only the region being replicated unwinds.
- The main enzyme involved is **DNA-dependent DNA polymerase**, which catalyzes polymerization of deoxynucleotides in the $5' \rightarrow 3'$ direction.
- Replication is:
  - **Continuous** along the $3' \rightarrow 5'$ template strand → producing the **leading strand**
  - **Discontinuous** along the $5' \rightarrow 3'$ template strand → producing the **lagging strand**
- On the lagging strand, short DNA segments called **Okazaki fragments** are synthesized in the $5' \rightarrow 3'$ direction, each starting from an RNA primer.

[Diagram: A replication fork showing:
- The parental double-stranded DNA unwinding at the fork
- **Leading strand** being synthesized continuously in the $5' \rightarrow 3'$ direction
- **Lagging strand** showing Okazaki fragments (labelled $5'_{3'}$) being synthesized discontinuously
- Overall direction of replication indicated by an arrow
- The fork structure with $5'$ and $3'$ ends clearly labelled on both template strands]

**Role of DNA Ligase:**

- **DNA Ligase** joins the **Okazaki fragments** on the lagging strand by forming **phosphodiester bonds** between adjacent fragments.
- It thus seals the nicks and produces a **complete, continuous daughter DNA strand** on the lagging strand.

**OR**

**Construct and label a transcription unit from which the RNA segment given below has been transcribed. Write the complete name of the enzyme that transcribed this RNA.**

RNA molecule (5'): A U G C A U G C A U G C

**Answer & Solution:**

> **Note:** As per the question, the RNA strand given contains Thymine (T), which is not possible in RNA. Taking U (Uracil) instead of T (Thymine), the corrected RNA strand is:
> $5'$-AUGCAUGCAUGC-$3'$

**Transcription Unit:**

[Diagram: A schematic transcription unit showing:
- **Promoter** region (boxed, on the left, upstream)
- **Structural gene** region in the middle, with:
  - **Template strand** (3'→5'): $3'$-TACGTACGTACG-$5'$
  - **Coding strand** (5'→3'): $5'$-ATGCATGCATGC-$3'$
- **Terminator** region (boxed, on the right, downstream)
- **Transcription start site** indicated with an arrow
- The resulting **RNA molecule**: $5'$-AUGCAUGCAUGC-$3'$]

**Enzyme:** The complete name of the enzyme that transcribed this RNA is:
**RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase** *(or more precisely, **DNA-dependent RNA Polymerase**)*.

### Q18.
Name the group of bacteria involved in setting **milk into curd**. Explain the process they carry in doing so. Write another beneficial role of such bacteria.

**Answer & Solution:**

**Group of Bacteria:**
***Lactobacillus*** and other **Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)** are responsible for the curdling of milk.

**Process:**
- These bacteria utilize and act upon the milk sugar **lactose**, leading to its conversion into **lactic acid**.
- The lactic acid produced causes **partial digestion and coagulation of milk proteins (casein)**, resulting in the formation of **curd**.
- Action by LAB also leads to an **increase in Vitamin B₁₂ content** of the curd.

**Another Beneficial Role:**
- On consumption of curd, these bacteria add to the **healthy and beneficial gut flora**, outcompeting the growth of **harmful gut flora** (pathogens in the intestines), thereby promoting digestive health.

### Q21.
Describe the formation of **recombinant DNA** by the action of **EcoRI**.

**Answer & Solution:**

**Formation of Recombinant DNA using EcoRI:**

- **EcoRI** is a **restriction endonuclease** that recognizes a specific palindromic sequence (**5'-GAATTC-3'**) and cuts between G and A on both strands.
- EcoRI cuts both the **foreign (insert) DNA** and the **vector DNA** at these recognition sequences, generating **sticky ends** (single-stranded overhangs: 5'-AATT-3').
- These **sticky ends** (also called cohesive ends) then **form hydrogen bonds** with their complementary sticky ends on the other DNA fragment.
- The joined fragments are then **sealed covalently** by the enzyme **DNA Ligase** (forms phosphodiester bonds), producing the **Recombinant DNA molecule**.

[Diagram: Showing:
- **Vector DNA** with GAATTC sequence being cut by EcoRI → generating sticky end with 5'-AATT-3' overhang
- **Foreign DNA** with GAATTC sequence being cut by EcoRI → generating complementary sticky end 5'-AATT-3' overhang
- The two sticky ends hybridizing via hydrogen bonds
- DNA Ligase sealing the nicks → producing **Recombinant DNA**]

**OR**

**Describe the process of amplification of "gene of interest" using PCR technique.**

**Answer & Solution:**

**PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) — Amplification of Gene of Interest:**

**Requirements:**
- Knowledge of the **sequence of the gene of interest** (to design primers)
- **Two sets of primers** (chemically synthesized oligonucleotide stretches complementary to the two ends of the gene of interest)
- **Thermostable DNA polymerase** (*Taq* polymerase, isolated from *Thermus aquaticus*)
- **Deoxynucleotides** (dNTPs)

**Steps of PCR:**

1. **Denaturation:**
   - The double-stranded DNA is heated to ~**95°C**.
   - Hydrogen bonds break and the two strands separate (denature).
   - *Taq* polymerase is **thermostable** and remains functional at this temperature.

2. **Annealing:**
   - Temperature is lowered to ~**50–65°C**.
   - The **two sets of primers** anneal (bind) to their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA templates.

3. **Extension:**
   - Temperature is raised to ~**72°C**.
   - *Taq* DNA polymerase extends the primers in the $5' \rightarrow 3'$ direction, synthesizing new complementary DNA strands.
   - This results in replication of the gene of interest **in vitro**.

- This cycle is **repeated ~30 times**, generating up to **~1 billion identical copies** of the target DNA.

[Diagram: Showing the three steps of PCR:
- Double-stranded DNA with the region to be amplified highlighted
- **Denaturation** (heat) → two separated single strands
- **Annealing** → primers (short red segments) binding to each strand
- **Extension** (Taq polymerase + dNTPs) → new complementary strands synthesized
- After 30 cycles → ~1 billion amplified copies of the target gene]

### Q22.
Two children, A and B aged 4 and 5 years respectively, visited a hospital with a similar genetic disorder. Girl A was provided **enzyme-replacement therapy** and was advised to revisit periodically. Girl B was given a therapy that did **not require revisit** for further treatment.

**(a)** Name the ailment the two girls were suffering from.
**(b)** Why did the treatment provided to girl A require repeated visits?
**(c)** How was girl B cured permanently?

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Ailment:**
Both girls were suffering from **ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) Deficiency**, a form of **SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency)**. This disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on **chromosome 20**, which codes for the enzyme **Adenosine Deaminase (ADA)**. Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down the toxic substance **deoxyadenosine**, which builds up and destroys **T and B lymphocytes**, severely compromising immunity.

**(b) Repeated Visits for Girl A (Enzyme Replacement Therapy):**
- Girl A was given **Enzyme Replacement Therapy**: lymphocytes were isolated from the patient's blood, cultured *in vitro*, and **functional ADA cDNA** was introduced into these cultured lymphocytes.
- These engineered lymphocytes were then returned to the patient's body.
- However, **lymphocytes are not immortal** — they have a limited lifespan.
- Therefore, **repeated infusion of genetically engineered lymphocytes** is required periodically, making it **not a permanent cure**, and the patient must revisit for further treatment.

**(c) Permanent Cure for Girl B (Gene Therapy):**
- Girl B was treated with **Gene Therapy**.
- The **functional ADA gene** was isolated and introduced into **bone marrow stem cells** (or cells at an early embryonic stage).
- Since bone marrow stem cells are self-renewing and continue producing lymphocytes throughout life, this is a **permanent cure** — the patient does not need to revisit for further treatment.

### Q23.
List **six advantages** of the **"ex-situ"** approach to conservation of biodiversity.

**Answer & Solution:**

**Ex-situ conservation** involves protection of plants and animals **away from their natural habitat** (e.g., zoological parks, botanical gardens, wildlife safari parks, seed banks, gene banks).

**Six Advantages:**

1. **Protection from exploitation:** Endangered organisms are protected from poaching, habitat destruction, and other threats, and can be maintained in **artificial habitats**.
2. **Regulated breeding programmes:** Breeding can be controlled and **gametes and embryos can be preserved** in viable and fertile conditions (e.g., cryopreservation).
3. **Preservation of genetic diversity:** Seeds from different genetic strains can be made to undergo **hybridization** and stored in **seed/gene banks** for future experiments.
4. **Health monitoring:** The health of individuals can be regularly monitored and **medical assistance** can be provided as required.
5. **Reproductive technology:** Modern reproductive technologies (e.g., IVF, embryo transfer) can **increase the chances of reproductive success** in endangered species.
6. **Scientific research:** Research into **reproductive physiology, lifestyle, and ecology** of an endangered species is made easier, aiding conservation planning.

### Q24.
While on a visit to a pond in the city-neighbourhood, the visitors were delighted to find a large expanse of water covered with colourful algal mass.

**(a)** As a student of biology, do you agree with their delight? Give reasons in support of your answer.

**(b)** Explain the cause of such algal growth.

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Agreement with the Delight:**
**No**, as a student of biology, one should **not** be delighted by this sight. What the visitors are observing is an **algal bloom** over a stationary water body, which is ecologically harmful:

- The algal bloom will **cut off the supply of light and oxygen** to the submerged flora and fauna of the water body.
- It will **outcompete** the water body's existing flora and fauna for nutrients.
- It will rapidly grow and **deplete other organisms** of necessary nutrients.
- The death and decomposition of algae depletes **dissolved oxygen** further, leading to a condition called **hypoxia/anoxia**.
- This will quickly lead to the **death, decay, and destruction** of the existing water body ecosystem — a process called **eutrophication**.

**(b) Cause of Algal Growth:**
- The **excess nutrients (nitrates and phosphates)** flushed out and washed from **excess fertilisers** used in nearby agricultural fields had accumulated in the pond.
- These excess nutrients **promoted a sudden burst in the growth of algae**, resulting in the algal bloom.
- This phenomenon is termed **Cultural Eutrophication** or **Accelerated Eutrophication** — an artificially accelerated form of eutrophication caused by human activities.

### Q25.
**(a)** Explain one application of each one of the following:

- **(A)** Amniocentesis
- **(B)** Lactational Amenorrhea
- **(C)** ZIFT

**(b)** Prepare a poster for the school programme depicting the objectives of **"Reproductive and Child Health Care Programme"**.

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a)**

**(A) Amniocentesis:**
Amniocentesis is a process by which **amniotic fluid** (fluid present inside the uterus surrounding the unborn baby) is withdrawn from the uterus of a pregnant woman using a needle, to **test for developmental and genetic abnormalities** of the foetus.
- **Application:** It can detect genetic disorders such as **thalassemia, Down's syndrome, haemophilia, anaemia**, and many other chromosomal abnormalities **before birth**, enabling informed decisions and early intervention.
- *(Note: It is banned in India for sex determination to prevent female foeticide.)*

**(B) Lactational Amenorrhea:**
Lactational amenorrhea refers to the **absence of menstruation (and ovulation) during the period of intense lactation** following childbirth.
- **Application:** It acts as a **natural method of contraception**. Since ovulation does not occur during intense breastfeeding, the chances of conception are **almost nil** during the first six months after childbirth, provided the mother is fully breastfeeding.

**(C) ZIFT (Zygote Intra-Fallopian Transfer):**
In ZIFT, **sperm from a donor male** and **ova from a donor female** are fused (fertilized) **in the laboratory (in vitro)**. The **zygote** (or early embryo up to 8 blastomeres) so formed is then **transferred into the fallopian tube** of the recipient woman.
- **Application:** ZIFT is used to treat conditions of **infertility** where the woman cannot conceive naturally, allowing the embryo to travel down the fallopian tube and implant in the uterus naturally.

**(b) Poster — Objectives of Reproductive and Child Health Care Programme:**

[Poster Description:
**Title:** *"Safe Life of a Child is Investment for Future"*

**Central image:** A mother and child symbol (silhouette of a pregnant woman/mother with a child) with a medical cross, surrounded by two green leaves labelled "Medical Services" and "Society"

**Key Objectives listed on the poster:**

**(a) Two Ways by Which Apomictic Seeds Develop:**

1. **Recurrent Apomixis (Diplospory/Apospory):**
   An embryo sac develops from the **megaspore mother cell without proper meiosis** (meiosis is disturbed/suppressed), resulting in a **diploid egg cell**. The embryo subsequently develops **directly from this diploid egg cell without fertilization** — producing seeds with the same genetic constitution as the mother plant.

2. **Adventive Polyembryony:**
   Embryos arise from a **cell or a group of cells** either in the **nucellus** or in the **integuments** (tissues surrounding the embryo sac), without meiosis or fertilization. For example, in **oranges, lemons (*Citrus*)** and **roses (*Opuntia*)**. Since it occurs outside the embryo sac, it is not grouped with recurrent apomixis. Embryos within the embryo sac may also develop simultaneously, giving rise to **polyembryony** (multiple embryos per seed).

**(b) Advantage and Disadvantage of Apomictic Crops:**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Advantage** | Hybrid vigour is maintained and these seeds can be raised to grow a new crop **year after year**, resulting in tremendous and consistent crop production without the need for repeated hybridization. |
| **Disadvantage** | Apomixis **reduces genetic diversity**, as all offspring are genetically identical to the mother plant. This makes crops vulnerable to new diseases or pests. |

**(c) Why is Production of Hybrid Seeds Costly for Farmers?**

The production of hybrid seeds involves the process of **artificial hybridization**, which requires:
- Labour-intensive steps such as **emasculation** (removal of stamens from bisexual flowers) and **bagging** (to prevent contamination by unwanted pollen).
- **Raising of seedlings in nursery beds** and controlled crossing.
- This requires **intensive labour** and is **economically not feasible** for small or marginal farmers.
- Additionally, **hybrid seeds cannot be used for the next season's crop** (as $F_2$ offspring do not maintain hybrid vigour), meaning farmers must **purchase fresh hybrid seeds every season**, further adding to their cost.

### Q26.
Differentiate between **incomplete dominance** and **co-dominance**. Substantiate your answer with **one example of each**.

**Answer & Solution:**

**Co-dominance:**
Co-dominance is the phenomenon in which **both alleles of a contrasting character are expressed equally** in the heterozygous condition, with neither allele being dominant over the other.

**Example — ABO Blood Groups:**
- ABO blood groups in humans are controlled by three alleles: $I^A$, $I^B$, and $i$.
- The alleles $I^A$ and $I^B$ are **co-dominant** — in an individual with genotype $I^A I^B$, **both** antigens A and B are produced on the surface of red blood cells, resulting in **blood group AB**.
- Neither $I^A$ nor $I^B$ suppresses the expression of the other.

| Allele from Parent 1 | Allele from Parent 2 | Genotype of Offspring | Blood Group |
|---|---|---|---|
| $I^A$ | $I^A$ | $I^A I^A$ | A |
| $I^A$ | $I^B$ | $I^A I^B$ | AB |
| $I^A$ | $i$ | $I^A i$ | A |
| $I^B$ | $I^A$ | $I^A I^B$ | AB |
| $I^B$ | $I^B$ | $I^B I^B$ | B |
| $I^B$ | $i$ | $I^B i$ | B |
| $i$ | $i$ | $ii$ | O |

**Incomplete Dominance:**
Incomplete dominance is a phenomenon in which **one allele shows incomplete (partial) dominance** over the other allele. The heterozygous phenotype is **intermediate** between the two homozygous phenotypes.

**Example — Flower Colour in *Antirrhinum* (Snapdragon):**
- A cross between **red-flowered (RR)** and **white-flowered (rr)** plants gives **all pink-flowered ($F_1$)** offspring (Rr).
- The dominant allele R cannot completely mask the recessive allele r, so the heterozygote shows an **intermediate pink colour**.

$$RR \text{ (Red)} \times rr \text{ (White)} \rightarrow Rr \text{ (Pink)}$$

**$F_1 \times F_1$ (Self-pollination of Rr):**

$$Rr \times Rr$$

| | **R** | **r** |
|---|---|---|
| **R** | RR (Red) | Rr (Pink) |
| **r** | Rr (Pink) | rr (White) |

- **$F_2$ Phenotypic ratio:** $1 \text{ Red} : 2 \text{ Pink} : 1 \text{ White}$ (i.e., 1:2:1)
- **$F_2$ Genotypic ratio:** $1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr$ (i.e., 1:2:1)

**Key Difference:**

| Feature | **Incomplete Dominance** | **Co-dominance** |
|---|---|---|
| **Expression** | Intermediate/blended phenotype in heterozygote | Both alleles expressed fully and simultaneously |
| **Example** | Pink flower in *Antirrhinum* (Rr) | AB blood group in humans ($I^A I^B$) |

**OR**

**(a)** Write the contributions of the following scientists in deciphering the genetic code:
**George Gamow; Hargobind Khorana; Marshall Nirenberg; Severo Ochoa**

**(b)** State the importance of a Genetic code in protein biosynthesis.

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Contributions of Scientists:**

| Scientist | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **George Gamow** | Proposed that if **20 amino acids** are to be coded by **4 bases**, the code must be a **triplet** (3 nucleotides per codon). Since $4^2 = 16 < 20$ and $4^3 = 64 > 20$, the codon must consist of **3 nucleotides**. |
| **Hargobind Khorana** | Developed a **chemical method to synthesise RNA molecules** with defined combinations of bases (e.g., poly UC, poly UG), helping to decipher which codons code for which amino acids. |
| **Marshall Nirenberg** | Developed **cell-free systems for protein synthesis (*in vitro* translation)**. He showed that poly-U RNA coded for polyphenylalanine, identifying the first codon (UUU = Phenylalanine). This helped decipher the genetic code. |
| **Severo Ochoa** | Discovered the enzyme **polynucleotide phosphorylase**, which helped in the **synthesis of RNA with defined sequences in a template-independent manner**, facilitating code-breaking experiments. |

**(b) Importance of Genetic Code in Protein Biosynthesis:**

The genetic code is a set of **three nucleotides (codon/triplet)** that code for a specific amino acid. Its properties and importance in protein biosynthesis:

1. **A codon is a triplet:** $4^3 = 64$ codons (61 sense codons code for amino acids; 3 are stop/nonsense codons — UAA, UAG, UGA).
2. **Unambiguous:** Each codon codes for **one and only one specific amino acid** — there is no ambiguity in translation.
3. **Degenerate:** Some amino acids are coded by **more than one codon** (e.g., Leucine has 6 codons). This provides a buffer against some mutations.
4. **Universal:** The genetic code is **nearly universal** — the same codon codes for the same amino acid in almost all organisms, from bacteria to humans. This is the basis of recombinant DNA technology.
5. **Commaless/Non-overlapping:** Codons are **read continuously** without punctuation marks between them.
6. **AUG (Start codon) — Dual function:** AUG codes for **Methionine** and also acts as the **initiation (start) codon** for translation.
7. **Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA):** Signal the **termination of translation**, releasing the completed polypeptide chain.

### Q27.
**(a)** What is **"population"** according to you as a biology student?

**(b)** *"The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter."* Justify the statement with specific reference to fluctuations in the **population density** of a region in a given period of time.

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Definition of Population:**
The term **'Population'** refers to a **group of individuals of the same species** living together in a **well-defined geographical area**, **sharing or competing for resources**, and **potentially interbreeding**. Although the term interbreeding implies sexual reproduction, a group of individuals resulting from even **asexual reproduction** is also considered a population.

**(b) Population Size is Not Static — Justification:**

The size of a population of any species is **not a static parameter**. It keeps changing over time depending on various factors including food availability, predation pressures, and weather.

The population density (N) in a given period changes due to the following **four factors**:

$$\Delta N = (B + I) - (D + E)$$

Where:
- $B$ = Natality, $I$ = Immigration, $D$ = Mortality, $E$ = Emigration

1. **Natality (B):**
   Refers to the **number of births** during a given period in the population, which are **added** to the initial density. Higher natality increases population size.

2. **Mortality (D):**
   Refers to the **number of deaths** during a given period, which **reduces** the population size. Higher mortality decreases population density.

3. **Immigration (I):**
   The **number of individuals of the same species** that have **come into the habitat from elsewhere** during the given period. Immigration **increases** population density.

4. **Emigration (E):**
   The **number of individuals** who have **left the habitat** and gone elsewhere during the given period. Emigration **decreases** population density.

Thus, if $(B + I) > (D + E)$, population increases; if $(B + I) < (D + E)$, population decreases — demonstrating that population size is **dynamic, not static**.

**OR**

**(a)** What is **hydrarch succession**?

**(b)** Compare the **pioneer species** and **climax communities** of hydrarch and xerarch succession respectively.

**(c)** List the factors upon which the type of invading pioneer species depend in **secondary hydrarch succession**. Why is the rate of this succession faster than that of primary succession?

**Answer & Solution:**

**(a) Hydrarch Succession:**
**Hydrarch succession** (also called **hydrosere**) is the ecological succession that occurs in **wetter areas** (e.g., a freshwater pond or lake). In this type of succession, the **successional series progresses from hydric (wet) conditions to the mesic (intermediate moisture) condition**, ultimately culminating in a climax community. It begins in an aquatic habitat and progresses toward a land ecosystem.

**(b) Comparison of Pioneer Species and Climax Communities:**

| Feature | **Hydrarch Succession** | **Xerarch Succession** |
|---|---|---|
| **Habitat** | Starts in a water body (pond/lake) | Starts on bare rock/dry area |
| **Pioneer Species** | **Phytoplankton** (free-floating algae) | **Lichens** (crustose lichens) |
| **Climax Community** | **Forest** (mesophytic/temperate deciduous forest) | **Mesophytic forest** |

*(The climax community in both cases is a **mesophytic forest** in a mesic environment, as both successions progress toward a similar stable climax.)*

**(c) Factors Determining Pioneer Species in Secondary Hydrarch Succession, and Why It Is Faster:**

**Factors upon which invading pioneer species depend:**
1. **Condition and fertility of the soil** already present
2. **Availability of water** in the area
3. **Environmental conditions** (temperature, light, humidity)
4. **Seeds, spores, and propagules** already present in the soil or nearby areas

**Why Secondary Succession is Faster than Primary Succession:**
- In **secondary succession**, the **soil is already present** (it exists from the previous community that was disturbed or destroyed).
- The soil contains **organic matter, nutrients, and soil microorganisms**, as well as dormant **seeds and propagules**.
- Therefore, pioneer species can establish themselves **quickly** without waiting for soil formation.
- In **primary succession**, soil must be **gradually formed from bare rock** (by weathering, action of pioneer lichens, etc.), which is an extremely slow process taking thousands of years.
- Hence, secondary succession proceeds at a **much faster rate** than primary succession.
