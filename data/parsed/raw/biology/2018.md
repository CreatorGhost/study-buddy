### Q6.
How did a citizen group called Friends of Arcata Marsh, Arcata, California, USA, help to improve water quality of the marshland using Integrated Waste Water Treatment? Explain in four steps.

**Answer:**
**Solution:** Wastewater including sewage can be treated in an integrated manner, by utilising a mix of artificial and natural processes.

(a) The conventional **sedimentation, filtering and chlorine treatments** are given. After this stage, lots of dangerous pollutants like dissolved heavy metals still remain.

(b) To combat this, an innovative approach was taken and the biologists developed a **series of six connected marshes** over 60 hectares of marshland.

(c) Appropriate **plants, algae, fungi and bacteria** were seeded into this area, which neutralise, absorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence, as the water flows through the marshes, it gets purified naturally.

(d) The marshes also constitute a **sanctuary**, with a high level of biodiversity in the form of fishes, animals and birds.

### Q7.
Your advice is sought to improve the nitrogen content of the soil to be used for cultivation of a non-leguminous terrestrial crop.

(a) Recommend two microbes that can enrich the soil with nitrogen.
(b) Why do leguminous crops not require such enrichment of the soil?

**Answer:**
**Solution:**
(a) *Azospirillum*, *Azotobacter*, *Anabaena*, *Oscillatoria* — (Any 2)

(b) Leguminous crops have a **symbiotic association with *Rhizobium* bacteria** which traps N₂ directly from the atmosphere and provides it to the plant; in turn, the plant provides food and shelter to the bacteria.

### Q8.
You have obtained a high yielding variety of tomato. Name and explain the procedure that ensures retention of the desired characteristics repeatedly in large populations of future generations of the tomato crop.

**Answer:**
**Solution:** The retention of desired characteristics in large populations of crop can be done by **micropropagation** (a type of vegetative propagation).

A small part of the plant is excised and grown under **sterile conditions** in a special nutrient medium to obtain many such plants which would be genetically identical to the original plants.

**OR**

The plants can also be propagated vegetatively by the **stem cutting method** to obtain genetically identical plants having the same desired characteristics as the parent plants.

### Q9.
(a) Name the source plant of heroin drug. How is it obtained from the plant?
(b) Write the effects of heroin on the human body.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**
(a) ***Papaver somniferum*** is the source plant of heroin drug. It is obtained by **acetylation of morphine**, which is extracted from the **latex** of the poppy plant (*Papaver somniferum*).

(b) Heroin is a **depressant** and slows down body functions.

### Q10.
With the help of an algebraic equation, how did Hardy-Weinberg explain that in a given population the frequency of occurrence of alleles of a gene is supposed to remain the same through generations?

**Answer:**
**Solution:** In a given population, one can find out the frequency of occurrence of alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle states this using algebraic equations.

This principle says that **allele frequencies in a population are stable and constant from generation to generation**. The gene pool (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains a constant — this is called **genetic equilibrium**.

The sum total of all allelic frequencies is 1. Individual frequencies can be named $p$, $q$, etc. In a diploid, $p$ and $q$ represent the frequency of allele $A$ and allele $a$ respectively.

- Frequency of $AA$ individuals $= p^2$
- Frequency of $aa$ individuals $= q^2$
- Frequency of $Aa$ individuals $= 2pq$

Therefore:

$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$

This is a **binomial expansion** of $(p + q)^2$.

When frequency measured differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates the extent of **evolutionary change**. Disturbance in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium — i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a population — is then interpreted as resulting in **evolution**.

**OR**

### Q10 (Alternative).
Although a prokaryotic cell has no defined nucleus, yet DNA is not scattered throughout the cell. Explain.

**Answer:**
**Solution:** DNA (being negatively charged) is held with some proteins (that have positive charges) in a region termed as **'nucleoid'**. The DNA in nucleoid is organised in **large loops held by proteins**. Also, the DNA in the form of a single chromosome is attached to the **mesosome** at a point.

## Section C — 3 Marks Each

### Q12.
How has the use of *Agrobacterium* as vectors helped in controlling *Meloidogyne incognita* infestation in tobacco plants? Explain in correct sequence.

**Answer:**
**Solution:** A nematode *Meloidogyne incognita* infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation based on the process of **RNA interference (RNAi)**.

1. Using ***Agrobacterium* vectors**, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plants.
2. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both **sense and anti-sense RNA** in the host cells.
3. These two RNAs, being complementary to each other, formed a **double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)** that initiated RNAi.
4. This **silenced specific mRNA** of the nematode.
5. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA.
6. The **transgenic plant** therefore got itself protected from the parasite.

### Q13.
(a) "India has greater ecosystem diversity than Norway." Do you agree with the statement? Give reasons in support of your answer.
(b) Write the difference between genetic biodiversity and species biodiversity that exists at all the levels of biological organisation.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**
(a) **Yes.** India has greater ecosystem diversity than Norway, having **deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries, and alpine meadows**.

(b)

**Genetic Diversity:**
1. Genetic diversity is the **total number of genetic characteristics** in the genetic makeup of a species.
2. A single species might show high diversity at the genetic level (e.g., Man: Chinese, Indian, American, African, etc.). India has more than **50,000 genetically different strains of rice** and **1,000 varieties of mango**.
3. Genetic diversity allows species to **adapt to changing environments** and ensures some species survive drastic changes by carrying desirable genes.

**Species Diversity:**
1. It is the ratio of one species population over total number of organisms across all species in the given biome. 'Zero' would be infinite diversity and 'one' represents only one species present.
2. Species diversity is a measure of the diversity within an ecological community that incorporates both **species richness** (number of species in a community) and the **evenness** of species.
3. For example, the **Western Ghats** have a greater amphibian species diversity than the Eastern Ghats. There are more than **2,00,000 species** in India, of which several are endemic.

### Q14.
Explain the mechanism of 'sex determination' in birds. How does it differ from that of human beings?

**Answer:**
**Solution:** In birds, sex determination is of **ZW–ZZ type**.

In this type, the **males are homogametic** and have **ZZ** sex chromosomes, and **females are heterogametic** with **ZW** pair of sex chromosomes.

$$\text{Parents: Male (ZZ)} \times \text{Female (ZW)}$$

$$\text{Gametes: } (Z)(Z) \quad \text{and} \quad (Z)(W)$$

$$\text{F}_1: ZW \text{ (Female)}, \quad ZZ \text{ (Male)}$$

Whereas in **human beings**, the chromosomal mechanism of sex determination is of **XX–XY type**. The **human male is heterogametic** and has **XY** sex chromosomes, and the **human female is homogametic** with **XX** sex chromosomes.

---

### Q15.
Explain out-breeding, out-crossing and cross-breeding practices in animal husbandry.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**Out-breeding:** Out-breeding is the breeding of **unrelated animals**, which may be between individuals of the same breed but having no common ancestors for 4–6 generations (out-crossing), or between different breeds (cross-breeding), or different species (inter-specific hybridisation).

**Out-crossing:** This is the practice of mating animals **within the same breed**, but having no common ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4–6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an **outcross**. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below average in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle, etc. A single outcross often helps to **overcome inbreeding depression**.

**Cross-breeding:** In this method, **superior males of one breed** are mated with **superior females of another breed**. Cross-breeding allows the desirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined. The progeny hybrid animals may themselves be used for commercial production. Alternatively, they may be subjected to some form of inbreeding and selection to develop new stable breeds superior to existing breeds. For example, **Hisardale** is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing **Bikaneri ewes and Marino rams**.

### Q16.
(a) Organic farmers prefer biological control of diseases and pests to the use of chemicals for the same purpose. Justify.
(b) Give an example of a bacterium, a fungus and an insect that are used as biocontrol agents.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**
(a) Chemical methods often **kill both useful and harmful life forms indiscriminately**. Eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is not only not possible, but also **undesirable**, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive.

(b)
- **Insect** = *Ladybird* and *Dragonflies*
- **Bacteria** = *Bacillus thuringiensis*
- **Fungus** = *Trichoderma*

---

### Q17.
(a) How has the development of bioreactors helped in biotechnology?
(b) Name the most commonly used bioreactor and describe its working.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**
(a) Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products. To produce in **large quantities**, the development of **bioreactors**, where large volumes (100–1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required. Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as **vessels** in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc., using microbial, plant, animal or human cells.

(b) The most commonly used bioreactors are of the **stirring type**. A **stirred-tank reactor** is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents.

- The **stirrer** facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor.
- The bioreactor has an **agitator system**, an **oxygen delivery system**, a **foam control system**, a **temperature control system**, a **pH control system**, and **sampling ports** so that small volumes of the culture can be withdrawn periodically.

### Q18.
Explain the roles of the following with the help of an example each in recombinant DNA technology:

(a) Restriction Enzymes
(b) Plasmids

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) Restriction Enzymes:**

1. Restriction enzymes belong to the class of enzymes called **nucleases**, which break nucleic acids by cleaving their phosphodiester bonds.
2. Since restriction endonucleases cut DNA at **specific recognition sites**, they are used to cut the donor DNA to isolate the desired gene.
3. The desired gene has **sticky ends** which can be easily ligated to a cloning vector cut by the same restriction enzyme, having complementary sticky ends, to form **recombinant DNA**.
4. An example is **EcoRI**, which is obtained from *E. coli* bacteria "R" strain and cuts DNA at a specific palindromic recognition site:

```
5' G A A T T C 3'
3' C T T A A G 5'
```

**(b) Plasmids:**

1. Plasmids are **autonomous, extrachromosomal, circular double-stranded DNA** of bacteria.
2. Since they are small and self-replicating, they are used as **cloning vectors** in genetic engineering.
3. Some plasmids have **antibiotic resistance genes** which can be used as marker genes to identify recombinant plasmids from non-recombinant ones.
4. The plasmids are cut and ligated with desired genes and **transformed into host cells** for amplification to obtain the desired products.
5. Examples of artificially modified plasmids are **pBR322** (constructed by Bolivar and Rodriguez) and **pUC** (constructed at the University of California).

### Q19.
Differentiate between Parthenocarpy and Parthenogenesis. Give one example of each.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**Parthenocarpy** is the process which produces **fruits from unfertilized ovules** in plants. Unfertilized ovules develop into fruits prior to fertilization. These fruits **do not contain seeds**.
- Example: Banana

**Parthenogenesis** is a type of reproduction in which an **unfertilized ovum develops into an individual** (virgin birth) without fertilization. It can be considered a method of asexual reproduction. It is shown by animals and some lower plants.
- Example: Seen in organisms like **rotifers, honeybees**, and even some lizards and birds (turkey).

**Key difference:** Parthenogenesis is shown by animals and plants, while parthenocarpy is shown **only by plants**.

### Q20.
Medically it is advised to all young mothers that breastfeeding is the best for their newborn babies. Do you agree? Give reasons in support of your answer.

**Answer:**
**Solution:** **Yes**, breastfeeding is the best for newborn babies.

1. Mammary glands start producing milk at the end of pregnancy. The milk produced during the **initial few days of lactation** is called **COLOSTRUM**, which contains **several antibodies**.
2. It helps in **developing resistance** for the newborn baby and helps the baby fight off viruses and bacteria.
3. Breast milk is packed with **disease-fighting substances** that protect the baby from illness.
4. Breast milk also naturally contains many of the **vitamins and minerals** that a newborn requires.
5. It is **easily digested** — no constipation, diarrhoea or upset stomach.

## Section D — 4 Marks Each

### Q21.
Draw a diagram of a mature human sperm. Label any three parts and write their functions.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

[Diagram: A mature human sperm showing the following labelled parts — Plasma membrane (outermost covering), Acrosome (cap-like structure at the tip of the head), Nucleus containing chromosomal material (within the head), Neck (short region connecting head and middle piece), Middle piece (with Mitochondria spirally arranged — energy source for swimming), and Tail (long flagellum extending from the middle piece)]

1. **Acrosome:** It is a cap-like structure, filled with **hydrolytic enzymes** that help in fertilisation of the ovum.
2. **Middle piece:** Possesses numerous **mitochondria**, which produce energy for the movement of the tail.
3. **Tail:** Facilitates **sperm motility** essential for fertilisation.

### Q22.
(a) Expand VNTR and describe its role in DNA fingerprinting.
(b) List any two applications of DNA fingerprinting technique.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) VNTR — Variable Number of Tandem Repeats**

- VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as **mini-satellite**.
- A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many **copy numbers**.
- The copy number varies from **chromosome to chromosome** in an individual.
- The number of repeats shows a very **high degree of polymorphism**.
- As a result, the size of VNTR varies from **0.1 to 20 kb**.
- After hybridization with a VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives **many bands of differing sizes**.
- These bands give a **characteristic pattern** for an individual's DNA, which is used to identify individuals — this is the basis of **DNA fingerprinting**.

**(b) Two applications of DNA fingerprinting:**

1. **Forensic applications:** Since DNA from every tissue (blood, hair follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm, etc.) from an individual shows the same degree of polymorphism, it is a very useful identification tool to **identify criminals**.
2. **Paternity testing:** Since polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis of **paternity testing** in case of disputes.

### Q23.
Looking at the deteriorating air quality because of air pollution in many cities of the country, the citizens are very much worried and concerned about their health. The doctors have declared health emergency in the cities where the air quality is very severely poor.

(a) Mention any two major causes of air pollution.
(b) Write the two harmful effects of air pollution to plants and humans.
(c) As a captain of your school Eco-club, suggest any two programmes you would plan to organise in the school so as to bring awareness among the students on how to check air pollution in and around the school.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) Two causes of air pollution:**
1. Burning of fossil fuels
2. Smoke released from vehicles
3. Industrial effluents
4. Smoke stacks of thermal power plants

*(Any two)*

**(b) Harmful effects of air pollution:**
1. It **affects the respiratory system** of humans and animals.
2. It also **reduces growth and yield of crops** and causes premature death of plants.

**(c) Two programmes for awareness:**
1. **Encouraging public transport** (i.e., buses) and using **CNG instead of diesel**.
2. **Planting more trees** (tree plantation drives) to curb pollution in and around the school.

### Q24.
(a) Write the scientific name of the organism Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues worked with for their experiments. Explain the correlation between linkage and recombination with respect to genes as studied by them.
(b) How did Sturtevant explain gene mapping while working with Morgan?

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) *Drosophila melanogaster***

Morgan carried out several **dihybrid crosses** in *Drosophila* to study genes that were sex-linked.

Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the **same chromosome**, the proportion of **parental gene combinations** were much higher than the non-parental type.

Morgan attributed this due to the **physical association or linkage** of the two genes and coined the term **linkage** to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome, and the term **recombination** to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations.

Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were **very tightly linked** (showed very low recombination) while others were **loosely linked**.

**(b)** Morgan's student **Alfred Sturtevant** used the **frequency of recombination** between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the **distance between genes** and 'mapped' their position on the chromosome. Today, **genetic maps** are extensively used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole genomes.

**OR**

### Q24 (Alternative).
(a) State the 'Central dogma' as proposed by Francis Crick. Are there any exceptions to it? Support your answer with a reason and an example.
(b) Explain how the biochemical characterisation (nature) of 'Transforming Principle' was determined, which was not defined from Griffith's experiments.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a)** Francis Crick proposed the **Central Dogma** in molecular biology, which states that the genetic information flows from:

$$\text{DNA} \xrightarrow{\text{transcription}} \text{mRNA} \xrightarrow{\text{translation}} \text{Protein}$$

[Diagram: Circular arrow showing DNA replication back to DNA, with an arrow to mRNA (transcription) and then to Protein (translation) — Central Dogma]

**Exception:** In some viruses, the central dogma is seen in the **reverse direction**, that is from RNA to DNA, as RNA is the main genetic material.
- **Example:** Retrovirus (HIV) — the process is called **Reverse Transcription**.

**(b) Transforming Principle:**

- In 1928, **Frederick Griffith**, in a series of experiments with *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, witnessed a miraculous transformation in the bacteria.
- He concluded that the R strain bacteria had been **transformed by the heat-killed S strain** bacteria. Some 'transforming principle' transferred from the heat-killed S strain had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.
- However, the **biochemical nature** of the genetic material was not defined from his experiments.

**Avery, MacLeod and McCarty's work:**

- **Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty** worked to determine the biochemical nature of the 'transforming principle'.
- They purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells.
- They discovered that **DNA alone** from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed.
- **Proteases** and **RNases** did not affect transformation, so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA.
- **DNase** did inhibit transformation, suggesting that **DNA caused the transformation**.
- They concluded that **DNA is the hereditary material**.

## Section E — 5 Marks Each

### Q25.
(a) Following are the responses of different animals to various abiotic factors. Describe each one with the help of an example.

(i) Regulate
(ii) Conform
(iii) Migrate
(iv) Suspend

(b) If 8 individuals in a population of 80 butterflies die in a week, calculate the death rate of the population of butterflies during that period.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a)**

**(i) Regulate:** Some organisms are able to maintain **homeostasis** by regulating their body temperatures. The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate body temperature are similar to what humans use.
- **Example:** Body temperature remains constant at **37°C**. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we **sweat profusely**; when the temperature is much lower than 37°C, we **shiver** — thus body temperature remains constant.

**(ii) Conform:** Many animals cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature **changes with the ambient temperature** — these are called **conformers**. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside.
- **Example:** *Shrews* and *hummingbirds*

**(iii) Migrate:** The organism can **move away temporarily** from the stressful habitat to a more hospitable area and return when the stressful period is over.
- **Example:** Every winter, the famous **Keoladeo National Park** in Bharatpur hosts thousands of migratory birds coming from **Siberia** and other northern regions.

**(iv) Suspend:** In animals, if migration is not possible, they might avoid the stress by **escaping in time**.
- **Example:**
  1. **Bears** go into **hibernation** during winter.
  2. **Fishes** go into **aestivation** to avoid summer-related problems of heat and desiccation.

**(b)** Death Rate = Number of deaths per individual of the population

$$\text{Death Rate} = \frac{8}{80} = 0.1 \text{ individuals per butterfly per week}$$

**OR**

### Q25 (Alternative).
(a) What is a trophic level in an ecosystem? What is 'Standing crop' with reference to it?
(b) Explain the role of the 'first trophic level' in an ecosystem.
(c) How is the detritus food chain connected with the grazing food chain in a natural ecosystem?

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) Trophic level:** Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a community according to their **feeding relationship** with other organisms. Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific place in the food chain — this is known as a **trophic level**.

**Standing crop:** Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular time — this is called the **standing crop**. It is measured as the **mass of living organisms (biomass)** or the **number** in a unit area.

**(b) Role of the First Trophic Level (Producers):**

- First trophic level is formed by **producers**.
- This is the **basic unit** of all ecosystems.
- These organisms can live **without feeding on any other level**.
- The only things these organisms need to survive are **sunlight and water**, which they can turn into energy themselves through **photosynthesis**.
- **All other trophic levels depend on this level** for energy.

**(c) Connection between DFC and GFC:**

**GFC (Grazing Food Chain):**
$$\text{Producers} \rightarrow \text{Primary consumers} \rightarrow \text{Secondary consumers}$$

**DFC (Detritus Food Chain):** Begins with **dead organic matter**. It is made up of **decomposers** which are heterotrophic organisms like fungi, bacteria, etc.

GFC is the major conduit for energy flow. DFC may be **connected with GFC** at some levels: some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals.

$$\text{Producers} \xrightarrow{\downarrow \text{Decomposers}} \text{Primary consumers} \xrightarrow{\downarrow \text{Decomposers}} \text{Secondary consumers}$$

These natural interconnections of food chains form a **food web**.

### Q26.
(a) Describe any two devices in a flowering plant which prevent both autogamy and geitonogamy.
(b) Explain the events up to double fertilisation after the pollen tube enters one of the synergids in an ovule of an angiosperm.

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a)**

**Autogamy:** Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of the **same flower**.
**Geitonogamy:** Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of **another flower of the same plant**.

Two devices that prevent both autogamy and geitonogamy:

(i) **Self-incompatibility:** This is a **genetic mechanism** that prevents self pollen from fertilising the ovules by **inhibiting pollen germination or pollen tube growth** in the pistil.

(ii) **Dioecious plants:** Male and female flowers are present on **different plants** — that is, each plant is either male or female (e.g., *Cannabis*, *Carica papaya*).

**(b) Events up to double fertilisation:**

(i) The pollen tube, after reaching the ovary, enters the ovule through the **micropyle** and then enters one of the synergids through the **filiform apparatus**.

(ii) After entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube **releases the two male gametes** into the cytoplasm of the synergid.

(iii) One of the male gametes moves towards the **egg cell** and fuses with its nucleus — this results in the formation of a **zygote (diploid cell)**. This is called **Syngamy**.

(iv) The other male gamete moves towards the **two polar nuclei** located in the central cell and fuses to form the **triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN)**. This involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei and is hence termed **triple fusion**.

(v) Since two types of fusions — **syngamy and triple fusion** — take place in an embryo sac, the phenomenon is termed **double fertilisation**.

(vi) After fertilisation, PEN becomes the **primary endosperm cell (PEC)** and develops into **endosperm**, while the zygote develops into an **embryo**.

[Diagram: Embryo sac showing — Central cell with polar nuclei, Egg nucleus, Synergid with filiform apparatus, Male gametes entering through pollen tube; second diagram shows polar nuclei and male gametes at the time of double fertilisation]

**OR**

### Q26 (Alternative).
(a) Explain the menstrual cycle in human females.
(b) How can the scientific understanding of the menstrual cycle of human females help as a contraceptive measure?

**Answer:**
**Solution:**

**(a) Menstrual Cycle:**

(i) The reproductive cycle in female primates (e.g., monkeys, apes and humans) is called the **menstrual cycle**.

(ii) The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called **menarche**.

(iii) In human females, menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about **28/29 days**, and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next is the **menstrual cycle**.

(iv) **Phases of the Menstrual Cycle:**

1. **Menstrual phase** — Lasts **3–5 days**. The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels, which forms liquid that comes out through the vagina. Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is **not fertilised**.

2. **Follicular phase** — Lasts **8–10 days**. During this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature **Graafian follicle** and simultaneously the endometrium of the uterus regenerates through proliferation. The secretion of **LH and FSH** increases gradually.

3. **Ovulatory phase** — Lasts **1 day**. There is **release of the ovum**.

4. **Luteal phase** — Lasts **13 days**. There is an **LH surge**. This induces the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle to transform as **corpus luteum**, which secretes **progesterone**.

(v) If fertilisation occurs, the endometrium starts **preparing for implantation**. In the absence of fertilisation, **corpus luteum degenerates**.

---

**(b) Scientific Understanding of Menstrual Cycle as a Contraceptive Measure:**

**(i) Safe Period (Rhythm Method):**
A week before and a week after menstrual bleeding is considered the **safe period** for sexual intercourse. The idea is based on following facts:
- (A) Ovulation occurs on the **14th day** of the cycle and the ovum survives for about **2 days**.
- (B) Sperms remain alive for about **3 days**.
